Data summary for Osier simulations

- The results for this simulation are pretty good, however the total system cost is significantly higher than Temoa's. This is
because Temoa truncates annual payments at the end of the simulation. In this case, the undiscounted objective for a single year
is essentially the same as dividing by the average technology lifetime (I made all technology lifetimes 25 years).

- I modified the capital cost calculation by dividing the average technology lifetime (25 years). Another successful run! The
least cost simulations were much more consistent with the value from Temoa. In fact, it looks like the (cost, co2) pair 
lies along the pareto front! However, the co2 values are a bit strange... I think the specific co2 (co2 / energy) were given in kg/GWh?
Since I don't trust these values, I want to run it again.

- The data are modified again. Now the CO2 values are in units of Million metric tons per GWh (confirmed by unyt).
