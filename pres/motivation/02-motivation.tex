    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Most climate change mitigation policies will overshoot U.N.
        emissions targets \cite{roelfsema_taking_2020}
        \item and there is still local public opposition to clean energy
        projects 
        \cite{aitken_why_2010,firestone_public_2012,stokes_prevalence_2023}

    \frametitle{Motivating Questions}

        \begin{block}{Question \#1}
            What drives public opposition to clean energy projects?
        \end{block}
        \begin{block}{Question \#2}
            How does energy modeling contribute to this problem? 
            % public testimony is dismissed as non-technical.            
        \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{What drives opposition? It's not NIMBY}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item NIMBY is popularly understood to drive opposition.
        \item However, several case studies and larger surveys have demonstrated
        that this is not the case \cite{konisky_proximity_2021,aitken_why_2010}.
        \item Instead, perceptions of legitimacy in decision-making processes
        motivates this opposition
        \cite{firestone_public_2012-1,stokes_prevalence_2023,
        aitken_why_2010,walker_procedural_2017,liu_effects_2020}.
        \item Public testimony may be dismissed for being nontechnical casting
        doubt on legitimacy \cite{johnson_dakota_2021}.
    \end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Final Motivating Question}

    \begin{block}{Question 3}
        How can members of the lay public adequately deliberate on issues
        perceived by experts as highly technical?
    \end{block}

\end{frame}

% \begin{frame} \frametitle{Enhanced Participation?}

%     \begin{enumerate} \item Although public hearings exist during licensing
%         procedures for many types of energy projects these hearings
%         \textit{close down} rather than \textit{open up} debate
%         \cite{wilsdon_see-through_2004,stirling_opening_2008}. \item This is
%         because public testimony can be dismissed as ``untechnical,'' such as
%         testimonies raising concerns about the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL)
%         running through Illinois \cite{johnson_dakota_2021}. \item Opposition
%         does not always stop but it can delay progress towards adopting clean
%         energy technologies, and the lack of participatory options does not
%         improve public trust in a technology, regardless. \item Does the
%         public even know what their preferences are? \item The issue
%         transforms into the following: how can we bridge the communication gap
%         between the lay public and engineers in a way that maintains technical
%         rigor but also directly incorporates public preferences?

%     \end{enumerate}

% \begin{frame} \frametitle{Energy Systems as a Social Experiment}

%     \begin{enumerate} \item Multi-objective methods are useful for
%         articulating preferences and identifying tradeoffs in an iterative
%         process. \item This iterative process is useful for highlighting the
%         priorities of the public. Especially in the sense of energy systems as
%         ``social experiments'' \cite{van_de_poel_nuclear_2011} the
%         consequences of which may not always be known in advance. But they
%         must always be considered in the context of alternatives, because
%         maintaining the status quo is also a social experiment which in our
%         present circumstances produces deleterious consequences for the
%         environment and human thriving. \end{enumerate}
