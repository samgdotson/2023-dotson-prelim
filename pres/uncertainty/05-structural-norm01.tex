        Generating prescriptive conclusions is the primary reason to model
        energy systems.\\~\\

        If the solution to structural uncertainty was identifying alternative,
        ``sub-optimal'' solutions, then the prescriptive stage means deciding
        among these diverse alternatives.\\~\\

        What are the consequences of Arrow's Theorem?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item There is no one-size-fits-all method for public engagement or
            decision-making.
            \item The methods of engagement must ``open up'' debate rather than
            ``close it down'' \cite{wilsdon_see-through_2004}. Expanding on this
            idea, multiobjective optimization ``help people to understand the
            problem better, explore their feelings, form a coherent, defensible
            set of values, and understand the implications of those values for
            the decision'' \cite{hobbs_optimization_1995}. 
        \end{enumerate}

        \begin{theorem}[Arrow's Impossibility Theorem]
            It is impossible to construct a utility function that maps
            individual preferences onto a global preference order without
            imposition or dictating \cite{kasprzyk_many_2013,
            franssen_arrows_2005,arrow_difficulty_1950}.

    \frametitle{Purpose of Multiobjective Methods}

    \textit{The second purpose of multiobjective methods is to help participants
    in the planning process define and articulate their values, apply them
    rationally and consistently, and document the resuits. The object is to
    inspire confidence in the soundness of the decision without being
    unnecessarily difficult. Multiobjective methods used in this manner can also
    help negotiation, by quantifying and communicating the priorities held by
    different interests \cite{hobbs_optimization_1995}.} \\~\\

    Although the usefulness of these methods were recognized long ago, the
    application of these methods was stunted by computational tools and data
    visualization capabilities.\\~\\
