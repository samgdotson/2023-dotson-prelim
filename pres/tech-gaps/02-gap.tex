%         \item Structural Uncertainty
%         \begin{itemize}
%             \item $\sim$100\% of ESOM frameworks optimize cost.
%             \item Stanard MGA procedures anchor alternatives to cost --- no true
%             tradeoff analysis.
%         \end{itemize}
%         \item Normative Uncertainty: Most ESOM analyses are prescriptive, few if
%         any articulate a normative premise to justify their conclusions.
%         \begin{itemize}
%             \item ``Pathway to 100\% Renewable Energy...'' --- a commonly
%             unjustified normative conclusion, right in the title!
%             \item Why should non-renewable sources be excluded? Renewable energy
%             is not guaranteed to be democratic \cite{winner_artifacts_1980}, nor
%             sustainable \cite{bell_toward_2020}.

    \begin{block}{Technical Gaps}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Exclusive optimization over system cost misrecognizes the plurality of 
            preferences and priorities. Tradeoff analysis is impossible.
            \item Even with open source code and transparent data sources, energy system
            models remain opaque --- decision making black boxes.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Proposed Work Component I: Multi-objective optimization}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Partially address procedural/recognition justice by facilitating tradeoff analysis 
            through multi-objective optimization with evolutionary
            algorithms.
            \item Develop an MGA algorithm for high dimensional space.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Stretch Goal --- Addressing Technical Gap 2}
        Further enhance the transparency component of procedural justice by developing this
        tool in a way that provides the \textit{capability} for anyone interested to 
        verify model results. I.e., make accessibility a design priority.
