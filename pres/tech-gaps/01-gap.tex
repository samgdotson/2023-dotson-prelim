    \frametitle{Gap \#1: Incomplete understanding of uncertainty}
    % normative uncertainty is not a subset of structural uncertainty because there can be purely pragmatic structural
    % uncertainties. For example, neglecting electrical resistance.

    Climate change is a ``wicked problem'' with many uncertainties \cite{grundmann_ozone_2018}. 
    
    Policies derived from theory or modeling practices ignorant of these uncertainties is partially
    responsible for the paradox identified previously.
    
    A more comprehensive understanding of these uncertainties will inform better modeling practices and 
    more just solutions.
