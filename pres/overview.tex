    \frametitle{Overview}

    I propose to:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Design an optimization tool that
        \begin{itemize}
            \item addresses structural and normative uncertainties,
            \item closes the gap between technical expertise and public preferences,
            \item enhances procedural justice.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Validate this tool by conducting a case study of energy planning processes
        in the Champaign-Urbana region.
    \end{enumerate}
