\section{\acs{mga} with \acl{moo}}
\label{section:mga-moo}

This thesis applies some ideas from \ac{mga} to the analysis of the
sub-optimal space from a \acl{moo} problem. Due to their iterative process, 
\acp{ga} naturally generate many samples in a problem's feasible space. However, this does not lead to a ``limited set'' of solutions but rather a potentially infinite set. Some literature developed \acp{ga} that directly use \ac{mga} in the iterative process \cite{zechman_evolutionary_2004,zechman_evolutionary_2013}. However, existing Python libraries such as \ac{pymoo} and \ac{deap} do not implement these methods, and the challenge
is not an inability to sample the sub-optimal space, but rather to provide a comprehensible
subset of solutions. The algorithm I developed in this thesis to search the near-feasible space is the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify a slack value (e.g., 10\% or 0.1). 
    \item Create a ``near-feasible front'' where the coordinates of each point are multiplied by unity plus the slack value.
    \item Every individual is checked if all of its coordinates are
    \begin{itemize}
        \item below all of the coordinates for at least one point on the near-feasible front
        and
        \item above all of the coordinates for at least one point on the Pareto front.
    \end{itemize}  
    \item Lastly, a subset of points may be randomly sampled from the interior points for analysis.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent
Figure \ref{fig:nd-mga} and Figure \ref{fig:3d-mga} demonstrate this 
algorithm with 10 percent slack for a 2-D and 3-D Pareto front, 
respectively. Figure \ref{fig:nd-mga} shows clearly that only points 
within the near-optimal space (gray) are considered. Illustrating this
behavior in three dimensions (and above) is considerably more 
difficult. The 3-D interior points should be covered by both surfaces,
obstructing their view. Figure \ref{fig:3d-mga} shows that this is the
case in three panels. First, a top view of an opaque Pareto front 
(green) where no interior points can be observed. Second, the same 
view with a translucent Pareto front, revealing interior points and 
the near-optimal front (blue). Finally, the view from underneath the 
near-optimal front once again obscures the interior points, except 
for two near the edges of the sub-optimal space. The tested points are
omitted for clarity.
