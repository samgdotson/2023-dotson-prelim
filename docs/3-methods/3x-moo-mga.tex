\section{\acs{mga} with \acl{moo}}
\label{section:mga-moo}

This thesis applies some ideas from \ac{mga} to the analysis of the sub-optimal
space from a \acl{moo} problem. Due to their iterative process, \acp{ga}
naturally generate many samples in a problem's feasible space. However, this
does not lead to a ``limited set'' of solutions but rather a potentially
infinite set. Some literature developed \acp{ga} that directly use \ac{mga} in
the iterative process
\cite{zechman_evolutionary_2004,zechman_evolutionary_2013}. However, existing
Python libraries such as \ac{pymoo} and \ac{deap} do not implement these
methods, and the challenge is not an inability to sample the sub-optimal space,
but rather to provide a comprehensible subset of solutions. The algorithm I
developed in this thesis to search the near-feasible space is the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Obtain a set of Pareto-optimal solutions \textit{using any \ac{ga}}.
    \item Decide on a slack value (e.g., 10\% or 0.1), which represents an
    acceptable deviation from the Pareto front.
    \item Create a ``near-feasible front'' where the coordinates of each point
    are multiplied by unity plus the slack value. This is equivalent to relaxing
    the objective functions and converting them to a constraint. 
    \item Every individual is checked if all of its coordinates are
    \begin{itemize}
        \item below all of the coordinates for at least one point on the
        near-feasible front and
        \item above all of the coordinates for at least one point on the Pareto
        front.
    \end{itemize}  
    \item Lastly, the set of interior points may be randomly sampled to further
    restrict the number of analyzed solutions.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent
Figure \ref{fig:nd-mga} and Figure \ref{fig:3d-mga} demonstrate this algorithm
with 10 percent slack for a 2-D and 3-D Pareto front, respectively. Figure
\ref{fig:nd-mga} shows clearly that only points within the near-optimal space
(gray) are considered. Illustrating this behavior in three dimensions (and
above) is considerably more difficult. The 3-D interior points should be covered
by both surfaces, obstructing their view. Figure \ref{fig:3d-mga} shows that
this is the case in three panels. First, a top view of an opaque Pareto front
(green) where no interior points can be observed. Second, the same view with a
translucent Pareto front, revealing interior points and the near-optimal front
(blue). Finally, the view from underneath the near-optimal front once again
obscures the interior points, except for two near the edges of the sub-optimal
space. The tested points are omitted for clarity.
