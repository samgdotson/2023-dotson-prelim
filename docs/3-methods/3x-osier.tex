\section{\acl{osier}}

\acf{osier} is a novel open-source energy system modeling framework for
\acl{moo}. There are currently no \acp{esom} that enable \ac{moo} and \ac{osier}
fills that gap. Figure \ref{fig:osier_flow} illustrates the flow of data into
and within \ac{osier}.

 Technology data, objectives, constraints, and a dispatch model are all features
within \ac{osier}, while \ac{pymoo} drives the optimization of these objectives.
The dispatch model is independently executable for inspecting specific test
cases and mapping solutions from other solvers onto \ac{osier}'s objective
space. The next section elaborates on the dispatch model's formulation.
