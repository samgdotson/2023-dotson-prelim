\section{\acl{osier}}

\acf{osier} is a novel open-source energy system modeling framework
for \acl{moo}. There are currently no \acp{esom} that enable
\ac{moo} and \ac{osier} fills that gap. Figure \ref{fig:osier_flow} 
illustrates the flow of data into and within \ac{osier}.

 Technology data, 
objectives, constraints, and a dispatch model are all features within \ac{osier}, while \ac{pymoo} drives the optimization of these objectives. The dispatch model is independently executable for inspecting specific test cases and mapping solutions from other solvers onto \ac{osier}'s objective space. The next section
elaborates on the dispatch model's formulation.
