\chapter{Proposed Work}

The literature review in Chapter \ref{chapter:lit-review} characterized the
wicked problem of climate change, identified the current gaps in \ac{esom}
methods, and motivated the need to incorporate ideas from a energy justice and
other non-engineering discplines, in order to fully apprehend the challenge.
Chapter \ref{chapter:methods} detailed the development of \ac{osier}, a novel
\ac{esom} framework designed to incorporate conceptions of energy justice. This
chapter outlines the future work to deepen the theoretical foundation of this
thesis, improve \ac{osier}'s functionality, and validate \ac{osier} as a useful
framework for enhancing decision-making processes for more just outcomes.

\section{Expanding the theoretical basis of this work}

This section elaborates on how I will expand the theoretical basis of this
thesis.

How will I expand the theoretical basis of this work? Or, rather, what
theoretical areas will my dissertation explore and expand?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Provide a detailed outline of the nuclear energy debate. What are the
    normative assumptions at play on both sides?
    \item Give a case study on the ways traditional decision making processes in
    nuclear energy (e.g., Yucca Mountain) led to poor outcomes, and show
    positive examples of inclusive processes (i.e., consent-based siting)
    producing superior outcomes.
    \item Provide a detailed outline for the challenges associated with solar
    and wind.
    \item How does the literature answer the question of ``what drives
    opposition to new energy projects?'' (It's not \ac{nimbyism}).
    \item Social movement theory and democratic processes
    \item Address ``normative uncertainty'' \cite{van_uffelen_revisiting_2024}
    and how it relates to ``structural uncertainty''
    \cite{decarolis_using_2011}.
    \item \textcolor{red}{Constructing a ``normative premise'' that situates and
    clearly articulates the usefulness of this work. I.e., ``define what
    `justice,' or `just outcomes' means for this work''}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{What drives opposition to new energy projects?}
Observing the dissonance between the awareness of anthropogenic climate change
and policy actions to mitigate the effects of climate change is one of the key
motivators for this work. Further, in instances where action is being taken ---
such as the construction of renewable energy projects following government
subsidies, for instance --- what drives public opposition? I will elucidate this
question by incorporating literature from social movement theory
\cite{mcadam_social_2017} into this thesis. Importantly, the literature shows
that \ac{nimbyism} is not the primary driver of public opposition to energy
projects \cite{konisky_proximity_2021}, rather, support for these energy
projects is more strongly conditioned on genuine public participation in the
decision-making process \cite{summers_influencing_2020,ottinger_procedural_2014,
walker_procedural_2017,barragan-contreras_procedural_2022,gonyo_resident_2021}.


\section{Improvements to \ac{osier}}

What technical features have yet to be implemented into \ac{osier}?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Issue: The current code is unacceptably slow for many-objective
    problems. The four objective model took 26.5 days to run. \textbf{Solution}:
    More work needs to be done on investigating the parallelizability of
    \texttt{CPLEX}. Alternatively, rather than using a \ac{milp} model to
    operate dispatch, using hiearchical model (i.e., a ``rules'' based model) to
    dispatch energy could enable multiple processes, reducing the computational
    cost of the problem. Additionally, this type of model is conceptually
    simpler than \ac{milp} and would make \ac{osier} more accessible.
    \item Issue: Data transparency and quality assurance. \textbf{Solution}:
    Quality data is essential to generating trustworthy results. The \ac{atb}
    produced by \ac{nrel} is considered the gold standard for cost projections
    for electricity generating technologies. \ac{osier} will directly integrate
    data from the \ac{atb}.
    \item \textcolor{red}{Note: You should emphasize the novelty of your MGA
    algorithm during your prelim.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Validating \ac{osier}}

\ac{osier}'s primary purpose is to translate policy preferences of the lay-public into
actionable energy visions for a given municipality. The idea is that if decision-makers 
used a tool like \ac{osier} to support their decisions and incorporate ideas from their 
constituents --- ideas that may be distinct from the preconceptions of decision-makers
themselves --- then stronger actions toward addressing climate change may be taken with 
more just outcomes. The last, and arguably most important, component of this thesis is 
to validate \ac{osier}'s usefulness in this regard. I propose validating \ac{osier}'s 
usefulness with a counterfactual case study of the energy visioning processes of three 
municipalities: Urbana, Champaign, and the \ac{uiuc}.

\subsection{Step 1: Reviewing the energy visions for each municipality}

Reviewing published documents related to their energy visions. Such as \ac{uiuc}'s \ac{icap}.

Compare the stated energy visions for each community with the literature \cite{elmallah_frontlining_2022}.



What will I do to ``validate'' framework I created (\ac{osier})?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The questions of interest are (\textcolor{red}{for each question, what
    information would I gain by asking it?}):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Would these municipalities use this tool?
        \item What are the energy priorities of these municipalities?
        \item How would employing this tool differ from existing visioning
        strategies or processes?
        \item What are the existing planning practices?
        \item Should there be more collective planning among the three communities?
    \end{itemize}
    \item The results of this analysis could take the form of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ``These are the stated energy goals of this municipality.''
        \item ``This is how the results from \ac{osier} would change the
        results.'' (Results in this case includes the ``optimal'' solutions for
        an energy future \textit{and} the ways the process itself would change.)
    \end{itemize}
    \item The methodology for this study includes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Interviewing public facing figures at each municipality involved
        in the respective planning processes. These subjects could include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item director of energy planning and public engagement
            \item organizations such as \ac{isee}, SECS, and SSC. 
            \item members of the \ac{uiuc} microreactor project (e.g., Prof.
            Caleb Brooks, Prof. Tomasz Kozlowski)
        \end{itemize}
        \item Analyzing the human-subjects data (interviews) with thematic
        analysis
    \end{itemize}
    \item What is outside the scope of this study? Although the intention behind
    \ac{osier} is to help translate policy preferences of the lay-public into
    actionable energy visions for a given municipality, interviewing and
    surveying members of the public is out-of-scope for this project.
\end{enumerate}
