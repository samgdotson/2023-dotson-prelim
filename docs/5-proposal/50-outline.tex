\chapter{Proposed Work}

The literature review in Chapter \ref{chapter:lit-review} characterized the
wicked problem of climate change, identified the current gaps in \ac{esom}
methods, and motivated the need to incorporate ideas from a energy justice and
other non-engineering discplines, in order to fully apprehend the challenge.
Chapter \ref{chapter:methods} detailed the development of \ac{osier}, a novel
\ac{esom} framework designed to incorporate conceptions of energy justice. This
chapter outlines the future work to deepen the theoretical foundation of this
thesis, improve \ac{osier}'s functionality, and validate \ac{osier} as a useful
framework for enhancing decision-making processes for more just outcomes.

\section{Expanding the theoretical basis of this work}

This section elaborates on how I will expand the theoretical basis of this
thesis.

How will I expand the theoretical basis of this work? Or, rather, what
theoretical areas will my dissertation explore and expand?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Provide a detailed outline of the nuclear energy debate. What are the
    normative assumptions at play on both sides?
    \item Give a case study on the ways traditional decision making processes in
    nuclear energy (e.g., Yucca Mountain) led to poor outcomes, and show
    positive examples of inclusive processes (i.e., consent-based siting)
    producing superior outcomes.
    \item Provide a detailed outline for the challenges associated with solar
    and wind.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{What drives opposition to new energy projects?}
Observing the dissonance between the awareness of anthropogenic climate change
and policy actions to mitigate the effects of climate change is one of the key
motivators for this work. Further, in instances where action is being taken ---
such as the construction of renewable energy projects following government
subsidies, for instance --- what drives public opposition? I will elucidate this
question by incorporating literature from social movement theory
\cite{mcadam_social_2017,mcadam_putting_2012} into this thesis. Importantly, the
literature shows that \ac{nimbyism} is not the primary driver of public
opposition to energy projects \cite{konisky_proximity_2021}, rather, support for
these energy projects is more strongly conditioned on genuine public
participation in the decision-making process
\cite{summers_influencing_2020,ottinger_procedural_2014,
walker_procedural_2017,barragan-contreras_procedural_2022,gonyo_resident_2021}.


\subsection{A tale of three uncertainties}
\label{section:three-uncertainties}

Section \ref{section:uncertainty} identified two uncertainties commonly
discussed in the \ac{esom} literature: Parametric and structural uncertainties
\cite{decarolis_using_2011}. Although these two uncertainties correspond to
different aspects of energy system modeling (and models writ large), they share
the important quality of being descriptive rather than prescriptive. However,
even though they are primarily used to describe modeled systems, the results of
modeling efforts considering these types of uncertainties are, often implicitly,
prescriptive
\cite{yue_least_2020,decarolis_nc_2018,cochran_la100_2021,bussar_optimal_2014}.
For example, although structural uncertainty acknowledges the existence of
unmodeled (or unmodelable) objectives the nature of mathematical optimization
requires modelers to choose at least one objective --- one success criterion ---
to optimize. I contend that this choice is always normative. Further, articles
identifying a pathway to ``100\% renewable energy'' make an implicit normative
assertion without justification or recognition of the plurality of morally valid
alternatives. This suggests the existence of another uncertainty: Normative
uncertainty. ``Situations where there are different partially morally defensible
--- but incompatible --- options or courses of action, or ones where there is no
fully morally defensible option''
\cite{taebi_bridging_2017,van_uffelen_revisiting_2024}. There is a connection
between structural and normative uncertainties. Choosing one or several
objectives to optimize implies a normative premise --- even if the results are
presented without a corresponding normative conclusion. The same could be said
for any choice in the development of an \ac{esom}: Spatial scale, time scale,
which technologies are included in the model, and more. Per the recommendations
of van Uffelen et al. 2024 \cite{van_uffelen_revisiting_2024}, I will construct
an explicit normative premise that undergirds the normative conclusions of this
work to address normative uncertainty. In essence, defining what ``justice''
means in the context of this thesis.

\section{Technical improvements to \ac{osier}}

What technical features have yet to be implemented into \ac{osier}?


\subsection{Parallelization}

The current code is unacceptably slow for many-objective problems. The four
objective model took 26.5 days to run on a computer with 32GB of memory and 6
cores. More work needs to be done on investigating the parallelizability of
\texttt{CPLEX}, or employing more computing resources. Alternatively, rather
than using a \ac{milp} model to operate dispatch, using hiearchical model (i.e.,
a ``rules'' based model) to dispatch energy could enable multiple processes, and
reduce the computational cost of the problem. Additionally, this type of model
is conceptually simpler than \ac{milp}. The combination of reducing
computational cost and theoretical overhead would make \ac{osier} more
accessible, which is consistent with the ethos of this work.


\subsection{\ac{mga} enhancement}

The \ac{mga} algorithm could yet be improved by developing a selection strategy
that more accurately captures the spirit of \ac{mga} by identifying 
\textit{maximally different solutions in the design space} 
\cite{decarolis_using_2011,yue_review_2018}. In this application, discussions
generated by presenting maximally different alternatives could alleviate
normative uncertainty as described in Section \ref{section:three-uncertainties}.
I will accomplish this by implementing an algorithm from computational geometry
that is frequently used in topological data analysis known as greedy
permutation, or farthest-first-traversal
\cite{cavanna_geometric_2015,eppstein_approximate_2020}.


\subsection{Data transparency}

Quality data is essential to generating trustworthy results. The \ac{atb}
produced by \ac{nrel} is considered the gold standard for cost projections for
electricity generating technologies \cite{nrel_2020_2020}. \ac{osier} will
directly integrate data from the \ac{atb} to its built-in technology classes.


\section{Validating \ac{osier}}

\ac{osier}'s primary purpose is to translate policy preferences of the
lay-public into actionable energy visions for a given municipality. The idea is
that if decision-makers used a tool like \ac{osier} to support their decisions
and incorporate ideas from their constituents --- ideas that may be distinct
from the preconceptions of decision-makers themselves --- then stronger actions
toward addressing climate change may be taken with more just outcomes. The last,
and arguably most important, component of this thesis is to validate
\ac{osier}'s usefulness in this regard. I propose validating \ac{osier}'s
usefulness with a case study of the energy visioning processes of three
municipalities: Urbana, Champaign, and the \ac{uiuc}. The research question is
then: ``Do decision-makers or energy planners perceive that \ac{osier}, or tools
like it, would be useful in enhancing collaboration between decision-makers and
their constituents?'' Although this case study focuses on a small sample, these
paradigmatic cases could be used to generalize the usefulness of \ac{osier} to
other locales \cite{flyvbjerg_five_2006}. The precise formulation of this
research question (or questions) is subject to change between now and the
beginning of this study. Since this research involves human participants it must
be reviewed by an ethics board.

\subsection{Reviewing the energy visions for each municipality}

Before conducting interviews with people that may use a tool like \ac{osier}, I
will research the background of each municipality considered by reviewing
published documents related to their energy visions, such as \ac{uiuc}'s
\ac{icap}
\cite{institute_for_sustainability_energy_and_environment_illinois_2020},
Utilities Master Plan \cite{affiliated_engineers_inc_utilities_2015} or the City
of Champaign's Comprehensive and Sustainability Plans
\cite{knight_champaign_2013,knight_champaign_2021}. I will also compare the
stated energy visions for each community with the literature
\cite{elmallah_frontlining_2022}. In addition to energy \textit{visions}, I may
evaluate the decision making process for specific energy projects. Such as the
microreactor project at \ac{uiuc} or the recent solar farm being constructed on
Market Street in Champaign. How do these projects fit with the stated energy
visions for their respective communities? How involved was the lay-public in
making these decisions? Who were the stakeholders? This step is important for
developing a grounded decision-making process that incorporates \ac{osier} or a
similar decision support tool. 

\subsection{Develop the hypothetical \ac{osier} procedure}

Before interviewing decision-makers and asking if \ac{osier} would be useful to
them I need to formulate a hypothetical decision-making process that includes
\ac{osier}. Further, there are a few ways results (i.e., energy futures along
the Pareto-front or in the near-optimal space, as described in Section
\ref{section:mga-moo}) from \ac{osier} could be used in a decision-making
process. The results could be presented in more of a raw, descriptive, form.
Similar to the presentation in Chapter \ref{chapter:benchmark-results}.
Alternatively, whoever organizes the planning process (e.g., city councils,
planning departments, etc.) could distill the complete set of results into a
manageable subset accompanied by an explanatory narrative. \ac{mga} automates
part of this option. The former presentation admits less normative uncertainty
from pre-filtering the simulation results, but is arguably less understandable
by the lay public. The latter is more explicit but an explanatory narrative
presents more opportunity for politicization. Unfortunately, adequately
addressing this question is out-of-scope for this study. However, I will present
interviewees with both options to create a partial answer.

\subsection{Deciding the interviewees}

In order to gauge the \ac{osier}'s usability, I will interview public facing
figures from each municipality involved in the energy or community planning
processes for their respective communities. Table \ref{table:subjects} lists
potential interviewees.

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \caption{Potential interviewees to evaluate the usefulness of \ac{osier}.}
    \resizebox*{\textwidth}{!}{\input{tables/subjects-table.tex}}
    \label{table:subjects}
\end{table}

The list in Table \ref{table:subjects} merely indicates who might be good
participants in this case study. Ideal candidates would have direct experience
developing an energy vision for their community and engaging with the public.
Additionally, the final list should be demographically diverse, to the extent
possible, in order to enhance the generalizability of this case study.

\subsection{Conducting the Interviews}

\textit{Interviews will be conducted and analyzed with the awareness that the
questions I ask, my choice of wording, and my demeanor when asking, all have an
affect on the answers generated by interviewees.}

\subsubsection{Questions about current planning processes}
The following questions are aimed at interviewees responsible for guiding the
planning process in each community. For example, they may be urban planners or
in charge of public engagement. These questions are not appropriate for an
external party that may be involved in the execution of an specific energy goal
but are nonetheless excluded from the initial decision making process.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How would you describe your community's energy vision or priorities?
    \item How did your community develop these priorities (or this vision)?
    \item Does your community have current best practices for making planning
    decisions?
    \item How does your community use modeling software to support its vision,
    if at all?
    \item What are the pain points you experience in developing these visions?
    \item What is the role of expert testimony/consultation/input in creating an
    energy vision?
    \item How do you percieve the dialogue between community members and its
    decision-makers?
    \item Does it seem like preferences or concerns from the community are
    incorporated? 
    \item Do members of your community understand why a particular decision was
    reached?
    \item How does the energy visioning process in your community consider the
    impact on its neighbors?
    \item Should there be more collective planning among the three communities?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Questions and discussion about modeling tools and \ac{osier}} The
previous set of questions set a foundation for energy planning from the
perspective of a decision-maker or planner. This set of questions deals
specifically with the usefulness of \ac{osier} 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item (After presenting results from this model in two ways) Which
    presentation do you think would best facilitate dialogue between the
    lay-public and decision-makers?
    \item What objectives do you think would be important to model in designing
    an energy vision for your community?
    \item Would your municipality use this tool? 
    \item If not this specific tool, is there a tool that exists/doesn't exist
    that is/would be useful?
    \item What changes would need to be made to \ac{osier} for it to be useful
    to you?
    \item How would employing this tool differ from existing visioning
    strategies or processes?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Generate insights with thematic analysis}

The interviews will be recorded and I will use the responses from interviewees
to conduct a theoretical thematic analysis
\cite{braun_toward_2023,maguire_doing_2017,scharp_what_2019}. Thematic analysis
is a qualitative method for determining patterns in a data corpus
\cite{scharp_what_2019}. 

The general process from Braun \& Clark 2006 \cite{braun_using_2006} is to
\begin{enumerate}
    \item familiarize yourself with the data,
    \item develop codes (I will be using an open-coding strategy where codes are
    developed in the process of reviewing transcripts, rather than being
    pre-determined \cite{maguire_doing_2017}),
    \item identify themes,
    \item review themes
    \item define themes, 
    \item locate exemplars.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Draw conclusions}

The conclusions of this study will have descriptive and normative components.
The latter will be understood in the context of the normative premise
constructed in light of the suggestion in Section
\ref{section:three-uncertainties}.

The results of this analysis could take the form of:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item ``These are the stated energy goals of this municipality.''
        \item ``This is how the results from \ac{osier} would change
        decision-making procedures.'' (Results in this case includes the
        ``optimal'' solutions for an energy future \textit{and} the ways the
        process itself would change.)
    \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Research limitations}

What is outside the scope of this study? Although the intention behind
\ac{osier} is to help translate policy preferences of the lay-public into
actionable energy visions for a given municipality, interviewing and surveying
members of the public is out-of-scope for this project. Further, determining the
needs of a group before developing code in earnest is essential for developing
an effective and procedurally just framework. This co-design practice is
important for future development of decision-support tools
\cite{gonzalez_developing_2022,ryder_developing_2018}.

Also outside the scope of this project is determining which form of the results
is most accessible to lay-audiences. Ideally with a much larger number of
participants I could do a/b testing to tease out an answer to this question.
