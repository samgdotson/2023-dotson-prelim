\chapter{Proposed Work}


\begin{enumerate}
    \item How will I expand the theoretical basis of this work?
    \item What technical features have yet to be implemented into \ac{osier}?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Issue: The current code is unacceptably slow for many-objective
        problems. The four objective model took 26.5 days to run.
    \end{itemize}
    \item What will I do to ``validate'' framework I created (\ac{osier})?
\end{enumerate}
