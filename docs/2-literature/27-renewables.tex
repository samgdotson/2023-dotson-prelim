\subsection{\textcolor{red}{If renewable energy can solve climate change, why build anything else?}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What do proponents of renewable energy say about solar and wind?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item By virtue of being renewable, the energy source is practically infinite. Solar energy will 
        never run out on the timescale of human civilization, and wind energy (as a product of wind energy plus
        the Earth's rotation) will similarly never run out.
        \item Since renewable energy, specifically solar and wind, lend themselves more naturally to distribution,
        they are more democratic sources of energy (cite).
    \end{itemize}
    \item What are the objections to fully renewable energy grids?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Wind and solar are variable and intermittent energy sources.
    \end{itemize}
    \item What drives the opposition for renewable energy projects (specifically wind and solar)?
