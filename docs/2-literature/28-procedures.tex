\subsection{\textcolor{red}{Current procedures}}


\textcolor{red}{In this section I want to cover the current issues related to siting 
energy projects and how they are executed. This should relate issues identified in the case studies
for siting a nuclear waste repository (as well as the successes!) and the challenges of siting renewable
energy projects. Once I have made this connection, I can summarize the case study on the Dakota Access Pipeline
done by McKenzie Johnson \cite{johnson_dakota_2021}. I can also refer to the process for obtaining a nuclear
reactor license.
Finally, it may be useful to identify a ``successful'' siting process? Such as the siting of a transmission line
in Ireland \cite{devine-wright_understanding_2020}.
This section also serves as a great segu\'{e} into discussions of energy justice. Since engineers are not 
typically equipped to do the kind of public engagement required to advance energy goals.}
