A multi-objective problem may be formulated as
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:generic-moop}
&\text{min}\{F_1(x), F_2(x), ... , F_i(x)\},
\intertext{subject to:}
&g(x, p) \leq 0.\nonumber\\
&x \in \vec{X}\nonumber
\intertext{where}
&F_i \text{ is an arbitrary objective function,}\nonumber\\
&g \text{ is a constraint,}\nonumber\\
&p \text{ is an arbitrary parameter of $g$,}\nonumber\\
&\vec{X} \text{ is the set of decision variables.}
\end{align}
\noindent
Where Equation \ref{eqn:generic_objective} had a single objective $F(x)$ to
minimize, Equation \ref{eqn:generic-moop} has a \textit{set} of objectives,
$\{F_i(x)\}$. Rather than identifying a global minimum point, the solution to
Equation \ref{eqn:generic-moop} is a \textit{set} of non-dominated points called a Pareto-front. Each point on this frontier cannot
improve one objective without making another objective worse, hence
``non-dominated.'' Generally, for competing objectives, there will be an
infeasible space that is not attainable by the given combination of objectives.
For a minimization problem, the space above the Pareto-front is the sub-optimal
feasible space. This is the space that \ac{mga} promises to search for a
corresponding single-objective problem. Figure \ref{fig:truss-pareto}
illustrates a set of solutions along a Pareto-front for an example problem from
\ac{pymoo} \cite{blank_pymoo_2020,deb_omni-optimizer_2008}.

  deb_omni-optimizer_2008}.}

\end{figure}

 There are broadly two classes of \ac{moo} algorithms for solving Equation
\ref{eqn:generic-moop}, \textit{scalarization} and \textit{population-based}
\cite{gunantara_review_2018, emmerich_tutorial_2018}. Scalarization approaches
map the multi-objective problem onto a set of single-objective problems using
variation of parameters. In the \ac{ws} algorithm, the objectives are assigned
weights, $w_i$, and the aggregated objective becomes
\begin{align}
    \label{eqn:weighted-sum}
    \text{min}\quad J(x) &= \sum_i w_i F_i(x)
    \intertext{subject to:}
&g(x, p) \leq 0\nonumber\\
&x \in \vec{X}\nonumber
\intertext{where}
&F_i \text{ is an arbitrary objective function,}\nonumber\\
&w_i \text{ is the weight for objective function $F_i$}\\
&J \text{ is the aggregated objective,}\nonumber\\
&g \text{ is a constraint,}\nonumber\\
&p \text{ is an arbitrary parameter of $g$,}\nonumber\\
&\vec{X} \text{ is the set of decision variables.}
\end{align}
\noindent
These weights are varied in order to sample points along the Pareto-front. 

Alternatively, the \ac{ec}
algorithm for scalarization chooses one objective from $\{F_n\}$ to solve and converts the others
into constraints, whose bounds are denoted by $\epsilon$. These bounds are
varied until the desired number of points on the Pareto-front is reached
\cite{gunantara_review_2018, emmerich_tutorial_2018}. This problem can be
written as
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:epsilon-constraint}
    &\text{min}\quad F_j(x),
    \intertext{subject to:}
    &F_2(x) - \epsilon_j \leq 0\nonumber\\
    &\vdots\nonumber\\
    &F_i(x) - \epsilon_j \leq 0\nonumber\\
    &g(x, p) \leq 0,\nonumber\\
    &x \in \vec{X}.\nonumber
\end{align}
\noindent
The sub-problem, Equation \ref{eqn:epsilon-constraint}, must be repeated for
each $F_j(x)$ and corresponding $\epsilon_j$ in $\{F_n\}$.

Scalarization is attractive due to its simplicity. However, this approach is
sensitive to problem convexity. \ac{ws} will never be able to sample points in a
concave region of the Pareto-front, and \ac{ec} will have poorly spaced samples
along a concave region. Further, these algorithms can only sample points on the
frontier, not the sub-optimal feasible space. Thus supporting the critique of
using \ac{moo} for handling structural uncertainty \cite{decarolis_using_2011}.

Fortunately, population-based algorithms, also called \textit{\ac{ga}} or
\textit{evolutionary algorithms}, resolve some of these issues by solving
Equation \ref{eqn:generic-moop} directly. \Acp{ga} are based on the principle of
natural selection. In a \ac{ga}, such as \ac{nsga2}, an initial population is
randomly generated using the problem's decision variables, the `fitness' of this
population (i.e., performance on each objective) is calculated, then a new
population is selected from the `fittest' (most optimal) individuals. This
process continues until a convergence criterion is reached. The advantages of
this method are
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a guaranteed solution, regardless of convexity,
    \item no prior knowledge is required to initialize the problem, as with
    \ac{ec},
    \item greater diversity of solutions (i.e., spacing of points along the
    Pareto-front),
    \item the sub-optimal space is sampled through the iterative process (though
    not uniformly).
\end{enumerate}
Specifically, point four address one of the primary criticisms of using \ac{moo}
to reduce structural uncertainty by obtaining points in the inferior region
\cite{loughlin_genetic_2001,zechman_evolutionary_2004,
zechman_evolutionary_2013}. An additional advantage of \acp{ga} is the ability
to incorporate more physics and simulations into the optimization procedure than
\ac{lp}, \ac{milp}, or scalarization allow \cite{loughlin_genetic_2001} because 
\acp{moo} can incorporate data from external models. 

Previous work handled structural uncertainty using \ac{mga} which samples unique
solutions from the sub-optimal space in a neighborhood around the global minimum
for a single objective \cite{decarolis_using_2011}. Researchers argue that this
approach is valid because there will always be structural uncertainty and
sampling the inferior region may offer insight for decision-makers.
\textcolor{red}{While structural uncertainty may persist it is not
\textit{irreducible}.} By increasing the number of modeled objectives \ac{moo}
reduces structural uncertainty. Further, ideas from \ac{mga} can be applied to
\ac{moo} by efficiently sampling the near-optimal space
\cite{loughlin_genetic_2001,
zechman_evolutionary_2004,zechman_evolutionary_2013,pajares_comparison_2021}.
The goal of \ac{mga} is to find a \textit{reduced} set of maximally different
alternatives to provide insight, where analyzing the full set of alternatives
would be overwhelming \cite{decarolis_using_2011, pajares_comparison_2021}.
Figure \ref{fig:near-opt-pareto} shows the near-optimal space around the
Pareto-front from Figure \ref{fig:truss-pareto}.

For these reasons, this thesis explores energy systems optimization and the
handling of structural uncertainty through \ac{moo} and \acp{ga}. Section
\ref{section:genetic-algorithms} reviews the details of the \ac{ga} used in this
thesis.

\subsection{Energy System Applications}
It is well understood that engineering and policy problems, which include energy
systems optimization, often require satisfying multiple antagonistic objectives
\cite{loughlin_genetic_2001,zechman_evolutionary_2004,
zechman_evolutionary_2013, chattopadhyay_need_2021}. However, the application of
\ac{moo} to energy systems in the literature is limited. Table
\ref{tab:moop-literature} summarizes the current body of work. As before, the
``public code'' column only indicates if the source code is accessible.
Additionally, the ``sector'' columns only indicate the presence of a feature,
not the relative maturity or sophistication of the modeling. There are six
``objective columns,'' indicating which objectives are considered the in the
model or study. A ``technology'' objective might optimize a specific technology
or set of technologies. For example, maximizing the percentage of renewable
energy in a system. The ``reliability'' metric varies among studies, but
generally refers to the potential for load loss. For all of the studies in Table
\ref{tab:moop-literature}, the ``environmental'' objective refers to \ac{ghg} or
``global warming potential'' \cite{de-leon_almaraz_deployment_2015}. Although it
could refer to other environmental impacts such as land use, water use, or
thermal pollution. 

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \caption{\ac{moo} used with energy systems.}
    \label{tab:moop-literature}
    \resizebox*{\textwidth}{!}{\input{tables/moop_literature.tex}}
\end{table}
Most of the studies in Table \ref{tab:moop-literature} used \ac{nsga2} to
identify the Pareto-front with a few using scalarization. Consistent with the
trend shown in Table \ref{tab:esoms}, every study in Table
\ref{tab:moop-literature} uses some economic or ``cost'' metric as one of the
objectives. Also consistent, is that none of these studies identified a metric
to optimize over social concerns. Laha et al. \cite{laha_low_2021} used
fatalities per GWh and employment per GWh as criteria for social sustainability,
but these were not objectives in their model, rather they were calculated
\textit{ex post facto} with scenario analysis. Riou et al.
\cite{riou_multi-objective_2021} investigated the tradeoffs among renewable
share, reliability, and total cost. Their findings were consistent with single
objective scenario analysis \cite{de_sisternes_value_2016}, that greater
renewable penetration leads to greater costs and less reliable energy with a
100\% renewable energy system being the least reliable or incurring the greatest
costs \cite{riou_multi-objective_2021}. 

Although previous work demonstrated the applicability of \ac{moo} to energy
systems optimization, there are significant limitations. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item{There are at most three modeled objectives
    \cite{riou_multi-objective_2021,de-leon_almaraz_deployment_2015,
    de-leon_almaraz_assessment_2013}.}
    \item{Where traditional \acp{esom} have many mature frameworks (as shown in
    Table \ref{tab:esoms}, there are no frameworks that use \ac{moo}.
    Simultaneously, none of the studies in Table \ref{tab:moop-literature}
    developed a framework. Prina et al. developed a bespoke and unlicensed model
    called ``Oemof-moea,'' however this does not constitute a framework.}
    \item{None of the studies in Table \ref{tab:moop-literature} allow
    arbitrary user-defined objectives.}
    \item{None of the studies incorporate social metrics into the modeled objectives.}
\end{itemize}

This thesis develops, \ac{osier}, a novel energy systems framework using
\ac{moo} that fills these gaps by using \acp{ga} that allows for efficient
modeling of many objectives, enabling user-defined objectives, providing the
option to make metrics of interest either objectives or constraints, and
incorporating ideas from \ac{mga} to provide insight from the sub-optimal
objective space.

The next section outlines attempts to incorporate social justice concerns with
energy system models.
