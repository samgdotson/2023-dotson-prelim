\section{Modeling and Quantifying Energy Justice}

We have already seen that incorporating energy justice into \acp{esom} is 
challenging and seldom attempted. The literature on energy justice and socio-technical
transitions tend to derogate modeling efforts as cold and calculating \cite{sovacool_energy_2015,sovacool_energy_2016}, and most models do not account for energy justice in either equations or analysis. However, there have been some notable attempts to bridge this gap. The first $\mathcal{N}$ papers explicitly use \acp{esom} in their analysis.

Patrizio et al. (2020) conducted a technology-agnostic `social equity' scenario that maximized the \ac{gva} of several countries' energy systems rather than minimizing the total cost \cite{patrizio_socially_2020}. \Ac{gva} is also distinct from social welfare because it measures contributions to \ac{gdp} from individual producers rather than maximizing surplus. This metric enables sector-specific analysis of the impacts of energy infrastructure on employment and sales. Equity, in this context, is identical to socioeconomic development as measured by \ac{gdp}. The researchers looked at a socio-technical transition for three countries: Spain, the United Kingdom, and Poland. They found that 
a 100\% renewable energy system would reduce labor compensation by 50-60\% in the UK
and Poland but could increase benefits in Spain. They argue this is due to the outsourcing
of manufacturing and mining jobs in the former cases, while Spain has enough domestic 
resources to accommodate the transition. The researchers did not analyze possible shifts 
in power dynamics related to the energy systems, but they did identify that there is no
one-size-fits-all solution to achieving net-zero carbon emissions.

Neumann \& Brown (2021) performed a detailed analysis of the European energy system considering the expansion of transmission networks and energy producers for a 100\% renewable energy system under cost
minimization \cite{neumann_near-optimal_2021}. They also used a novel formulation of 
\ac{mga} to identify the boundaries of the feasible space for each technology within 
different levels of tolerance. This study uses Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients to 
measure the uniformity of the distribution of energy production and consumption. In other
words, the most equitable distribution of energy resources would accord with energy consumption \cite{neumann_near-optimal_2021}. The researchers conclude that wind power
and greater transmission capacity are associated with less regional equity, while solar
power and storage technologies lead to a more even distribution of the power supply. This
is useful for measuring the distribution of energy benefits from the energy system but 
does not consider the distribution of costs nor consider regional preferences. 

Chapman et al. (2018) looked at the energy justice implications of transitioning coal
plants to renewable energy projects for the nearby communities \cite{chapman_prioritizing_2018}. 
They measure distributional justice with ``relative equity'' and ``policy burden.''
Relative equity accounts for factors such as \ac{ghg} reduction, employment, electricity
cost, and health impacts. Policy burden is a weighted value according to the income level 
of each community. These two quantities were plotted together to identify a retirement
schedule that maximizes equity outcomes and ensures that burdens are borne by the 
ablest communities \cite{chapman_prioritizing_2018}. Additionally, the researchers 
argue that by using equity measures to inform policy choices, those policy decisions are
more procedurally just. However, this neglects meaningful participation and may or
may not address decision-making transparency \cite{sovacool_energy_2015}. Further, this
study does not consider how replacing dispatchable suppliers with \ac{vre} will affect
the availability and affordability of electricity \cite{sovacool_energy_2015}.

Mayfield et al. (2019) quantified the social equity implications for the expansion
of natural gas infrastructure in Appalachia using spatial and temporal metrics such as 
job-years generated by greater gas development, premature deaths caused by air pollution, changes in poverty and income, and the distribution of these various benefits along 
regional, racial, and economic lines. Additionally, they identified some of the
intergenerational equity impacts of climate change and expanded gas infrastructure.

\subsection{Enabling Procedural Justice Through Energy Models}

Traditionally, \acp{esom} are used to inform policy-makers \cite{li_open_2020} in order
to infuse policy choices with an appearance of objectivity. Indeed, some of the studies reviewed in
the previous section argue that this infusion will lead to greater procedural and 
recognitional justice outcomes as long as the policies maximize some measure of energy 
justice \cite{chapman_prioritizing_2018, heffron_resolving_2015}. However, these types of 
detailed analyses may also be used to dismiss concerns or opposition from the public due 
to insufficient `technical expertise' \cite{johnson_dakota_2021}. Further, without 
meaningful participation from the affected public, this approach is further entrenches procedural injustices.
To credit the energy modeling community, there is significant awareness of the importance
of transparency and repeatability in the space \cite{decarolis_case_2012, pfenninger_energy_2014, pfenninger_openmod_nodate, forster_open_2022, hilpert_open_2018}. 
Yet these two goals are challenged by the computational resources required to run the more
complex and detailed models, as well as the learning curve necessary to understand and 
modify the model inputs themselves. There has been some effort to reduce this learning
curve and make modeling itself more accessible. Frameworks such as METIS, EnergyRT, and \ac{pygen} all emphasize reproducibility, user-friendliness, and a shallower
learning curve \cite{sakellaris_metis_2018, lugovoy_energyrt_2022, dotson_python_2021}. The creators of METIS state their goal is to ``close the gap between modelers and policy-makers, enabling policy-makers to become modelers'' \cite{sakellaris_metis_2018}. However, these frameworks do not offer computational resources to run their models. The
\ac{temoa} project offers limited cloud computing capabilities, free of charge \cite{temoa_project_temoa_2023}. However, the responsibility for creating an input file still falls to the user, which can be overwhelming even for experienced modelers. Finally,
it's not clear that perfectly accessible and transparent modeling tools will translate to
more procedurally just policy-making. The next section outlines one method used to 
address this challenge.

\subsection{\Acl{pve}}

Even if the public could use modeling tools, their testimony may still be dismissed due
to a `lack of expertise.' However, the public has preferences that should be incorporated 
into decision-making. Additionally, community members are frequently able to assess trade-offs when presented with them. 
\Acf{pve} is one method for translating community preferences into just policy outcomes.
Researchers in the Netherlands developed this method to enhance democratic participation
and infuse policies with genuine feedback from constituents \cite{mouter_introduction_2019}. They observed that a common method of assessing social
impacts is \ac{wtp}, which is the maximum price an individual is willing to pay for a good or service, yet individual purchasing habits do not necessarily reflect their views
on public policy due to the relative salience of moral considerations \cite{mouter_introduction_2019}. With \ac{pve}, participants can allocate 
a specific amount of the public budget for certain policies, including levying or 
reducing taxes for greater or lesser government spending \cite{mouter_introduction_2019}.
Researchers applied \ac{pve} in three different settings, mobility and transportation \cite{mouter_contrasting_2021}, flood risk projects (i.e., a climate hazard 
\textit{infrastructure} response) \cite{dekker_economics_2019}, and with a phaseout of
natural gas \cite{mouter_including_2021}. Importantly, the studies also measured
the impact of these interventions and found that \ac{pve} enables participation from
people that do not typically participate (recognition), the results were useful for
decision-making and participation was meaningful for the majority of subjects \cite{mouter_including_2021}. Although previous applications of \ac{pve} focused on 
economic policy levers, this approach offers a promising pathway toward identifying
equitable and just energy mixes for the future.

In summary, climate change is a multi-dimensional existential threat to society. Transitioning to a zero-carbon economy by decarbonizing our energy systems may prevent 
the worst outcomes of climate change. However, energy systems do not only transport 
electrons and gas but also mediate socio-political power. Therefore this transition must be done equitably in order to avoid entrenching further injustices. The existing energy system modeling tools and literature routinely ignore the social dimensions of these systems and forego true trade-off analysis. Additionally, it's unclear whether improving
these modeling practices will correspond to just energy policy outcomes. This thesis
attempts to bridge the gap between energy system modeling and energy justice by developing
a novel framework that allows multiple, and perhaps non-economic, objectives and is 
designed for transparency and usability by non-modelers to inform energy policy decisions.
A framework such as the one developed in this thesis may be used in conjunction with
a policy process like \ac{pve} to fully enclose the triumvirate of energy justice tenets: distribution, procedure, and recognition.
