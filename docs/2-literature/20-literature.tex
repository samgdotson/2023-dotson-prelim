\chapter{Literature Review}
Every year, world leaders meet to discuss plans to address climate change at the
COP summit (cite). In 1995, world leaders established a set of targets with the
Kyoto Protocol (cite) and again with the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement. Every few
years, the United Nations releases a report from the \ac{ipcc} assessing the
current impacts of climate change and forecasting future scenarios. Most of the
world understands that anthropogenic climate change is an existential threat to
society. Indeed, many studies in the \ac{esom} literature begin with a statement
about the urgency of climate change. This chapter reviews the extant literature
for both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the problem considered in this
thesis -- primarily bridging the gap between feasibility or planning studies to
address the climate crisis and the current pattern of missed targets and growing
carbon emissions. First, I draw from the risk assessment literature to
characterize and situate the problem of climate change and demonstrate the
necessity of a holistic analysis. Second, I build upon the central issue of
disproportionality of climate change risk by reviewing the energy and
environmental justice literature. Third, I develop an encompassing definition of
an ``energy system'' using technical and social perspectives. Finally, I review
the energy system literature for gaps in conventional modeling practices and
identify previous attempts to incorporate social science and justice concepts
into energy system models.

% The first section reviews methods and attempts to model energy systems for
% planning purposes. The second section reviews the ways social movements help
% or hinder various energy projects, how governments succeed or fail to achieve
% their energy goals from this perspective, and why some communities favor or
% disfavor energy projects.
