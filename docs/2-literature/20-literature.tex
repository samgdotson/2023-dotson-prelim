\chapter{Literature Review}

This chapter reviews the extant literature for both quantitative and qualitative
analyses of the problem considered in this thesis -- primarily bridging the gap 
between feasibility or planning studies and realized futures (via public policy and or 
social movements). The first section reviews methods and attempts to model energy 
systems for planning purposes. The second section reviews the ways social movements 
help or hinder various energy projects, how governments succeed or fail to achieve 
their energy goals from this perspective, and why some communities favor or disfavor
energy projects.
