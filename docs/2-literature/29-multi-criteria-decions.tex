\subsection{\textcolor{red}{Working title: \Ac{moo} in other fields}}

Questions to address:

\textcolor{red}{\begin{enumerate}
    \item Possibly discuss ``Arrow's Theorem?'' \cite{franssen_arrows_2005}
    \item Are there any examples of \ac{moo} being used in other fields?
    \item In these examples, do any of them use genetic algorithms?
    \item How similar are these fields to energy system planning?
    \item Do any of these studies allow users to create arbitrary objectives?
    \item How are these studies used in planning processes?
    \item Do any of these studies explicitly discuss concepts of justice and how
    that work could be used to advance or hinder justice initiatives?
    \item What objectives do these studies optimize over?
\end{enumerate}}
