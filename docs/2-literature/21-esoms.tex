\section{Modeling Energy Systems}
\label{section:esoms}

\Acp{esom} have broad utility, including forecasting future quantities,
generating insight for policy development, or energy system planning for
scheduling and acquisition \cite{decarolis_using_2011, yue_review_2018}.
However, analyses using currently available \acp{esom} seldom consider the role
of energy systems in creating and maintaining inequitable distributions of
burdens. \acp{esom} vary significantly by the energy sectors they
choose to model, the degree of physical detail, uncertainty quanitification, 
and forecasting capabilities. Table \ref{tab:esoms} summarizes the capabilities 
for a comprehensive
list of energy system analysis tools. These tools are approximately sorted by
mathematical formulation, e.g. explicit optimization or simulation. The
``\ac{milp}'' column indicates whether the framework uses a linear-programming
approach to optimize an objective function. The ``objective'' column specifies
the nature of the objective function if one exists. ``Cost'' objectives minimize
total or annual energy costs, while ``welfare'' maximizes social welfare. Some
entries have more than one objective listed. This means users may choose which
objective to optimize. None of the tools in Table \ref{tab:esoms} are designed
to handle simultaneous optimization (i.e., \ac{moo}). For those modeling
frameworks that have an ``objective'' in Table \ref{tab:esoms}, virtually all of
them optimize system costs. EnergyScope is the only exception to this, which
allows users to optimize \ac{ghg} emissions \cite{limpens_energyscope_2019}.
\textcolor{black}{The ``uncertainty'' column indicates a feature to
algorithmically generate model runs for testing either parametric or structural
uncertainties. \textcolor{black}{For example, EnergyScope is \textit{suitable}
for uncertainty analysis (i.e., many runs are computationally tractable) but
does not have any built-in capabilities \cite{limpens_energyscope_2019}.} Some
tools, such as NEMS \cite{nalley_national_2019}, incorporate uncertainty into
their calculations via learning curves. However, these learning curves require
assumptions about learning factors and technological ``optimism'' --  which are
themselves uncertain \cite{nalley_national_2019}.} Table \ref{tab:esoms} also
indicates whether the tool is a ``public code.'' This simply means users can
download and inspect the source code. Other considerations for openness, such as
licensing and development, vary among the listed frameworks.
\textcolor{black}{The other columns simply indicate the existence of particular
features rather than the relative maturity or sophistication of each feature.} 

Frameworks, such as MEDEAS \cite{capellan-perez_medeas_2020}, and MultiMod
\cite{huppmann_market_2014}, are general equilibrium models which embed energy
systems within the macro-economy and facilitate the modeling of strategic
behavior. The latter formulates a non-linear problem with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
optimality condition \cite{huppmann_market_2014}, as opposed to more traditional
linear programming methods. Models of this type are helpful for analyzing the
economy-wide influence of policies but lack sufficient operational detail to be
prescriptive for energy system planning.

\textcolor{black}{Agent-based models are useful for modeling the market
behaviors of different actors, such as firms (which produce power), transmission
operators, and consumers. The latter category is typically aggregated for
tractability. Modeled behaviors include technology preferences
\cite{anwar_modeling_2022, zade_quantifying_2020}, risk aversion
\cite{anwar_modeling_2022}, financial characteristics \cite{anwar_modeling_2022,
nitsch_economic_2021}, and information asymmetry among agents
\cite{anwar_modeling_2022, nitsch_economic_2021}. Due to agent heterogeneity,
agent-based models are considered useful for capturing social phenomena
\cite{yue_review_2018,fattahi_systemic_2020}.}

A further set of tools focus on simulating power flow and demand fluctuations.
\textcolor{black}{CAPOW \cite{su_open_2020} generates synthetic data with
statistical methods to explore uncertainties in energy dispatch and extreme
demand events, but does not include any investment optimization based on these
uncertainties.} \textcolor{black}{CESAR-P, SAM, Demod, and DESSTinEE focus on
modeling demand profiles
\cite{leoniefierz_hues-platformcesar-p-core_2021,bosmann_shape_2015,barsanti_socio-technical_2021}.
CESAR-P models individual building demand for energy based on the physical
parameters of the building. However, it has no dispatch or investment
optimization capabilities.} Other tools such as Pandapower, GridCal, and SciGRID
power model the infrastructure aspects of electricity systems -- transmission
and distribution -- rather than the optimal dispatch of electricity producers
\cite{thurner_pandapower_2018, vera_gridcal_2022, matke_structure_2017}.

There is an overwhelming number of models with varying levels sophistication and
capabilities. However, the inability to optimize any objective besides cost presents
a significant gap in the existing space of energy modeling tools. Further, since none 
of these tools allow for multiple objectives, true trade off analysis is rendered impossible.

\subsection{Economic Dispatch and Social Welfare}
\Ac{lp} or \ac{milp} are the dominant optimization approaches among the
frameworks in Table \ref{tab:esoms}. Economic dispatch models optimize the power
output of \textit{dispatchable} generators in a model system
\cite{de_queiroz_repurposing_2019, neumann_near-optimal_2021}. They all share
the same fundamental formulation.
\begin{align}
    \intertext{Minimize}
    \label{eqn:generic_objective}
    &F(x) = \sum_i C_i x_i\\
    % &F(x) = \sum_t^T\left[\sum_i^{N_g}{C_i^g x_i} - \sum_j^{N_d}{C_j^d x_j}\right],\\
    \intertext{subject to,}
    % &\sum_i{x_i} - \sum_j{x_j} = 0\\
    &g(x, p) \leq 0.\nonumber\\
    &x \in \vec{X}\nonumber\\
    \intertext{where}
    &\vec{X} \text{ is the set of decision variables,}\nonumber\\
    & C_i \text{ is the \textit{i-th} cost,}\nonumber\\
    & g \text{ is some linear inequality constraint,}\nonumber\\
    & p \text{ is some arbitrary parameter.}\nonumber
\end{align}
The exact formulation of Equation \ref{eqn:generic_objective} may vary slightly
across models, but the objective for most economic dispatch models is to
minimize total cost. The near universality of a cost-based objective function
comes from the concept of \textit{social welfare maximization}. This concept is
illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:social-max}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/social_max.pgf}}
  \caption{Demonstration of ``social welfare maximization.'' Plot a) shows the
  total surplus when the price is at equilibrium. Plot b) shows the total
  surplus when the price is artificially depressed.}
  \label{fig:social-max}
\end{figure}

In microeconomics, social welfare is identical to the sum of consumer and
producer surplus. Therefore social welfare is maximized when the sum of these
two quantities is maximized. Figure \ref{fig:social-max} shows this case on the
left panel. However, suppose an economic policy capped the price of some product
at a price lower than the equilibrium price. In that case, the consumer surplus
expands, and the producer surplus contracts, as shown in the right panel of
Figure \ref{fig:social-max}. Nobody receives the ``lost surplus'' because
suppliers do not produce more despite unmet demand for the product because the
price is capped. Typically, modeling tools consolidate the demand curve to a
single value. \textcolor{black}{In this case, social welfare maximization is
approximated by minimizing the total cost of energy
\cite{richstein_cross-border_2014}}. This simplification is valid because demand
for energy is highly inelastic \cite{heuberger_power_2017, eia_price_2021,
labandeira_meta-analysis_2017, csereklyei_price_2020}. Figure
\ref{fig:inelastic} shows the impact of highly inelastic demand.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/elasticity.pgf}}
  \caption{Demonstration of ``price elasticity.'' Plot a) shows a typical supply-demand curve where changes in price lead to proportional changes in demand. Plot b) shows an inelastic demand where consumption does not change proportionally with price.}
  \label{fig:inelastic}
\end{figure}

For an elastic good supply and demand are in proportion with each other. An
increase in the supply leads to a proportional increase in demand via a reduced
price, eventually returning to an equilibrium price (shown in Figure
\ref{fig:inelastic}a). However, as Figure \ref{fig:inelastic}b demonstrates, an
inelastic demand does not respond proportionally to changes in price, such that
consumers become ``price- takers,'' paying the price set by producers.
Importantly, in the latter case consumer surplus is infinite and minimizing the
energy cost through policy mechanisms does not create a lost surplus as shown in
Figure \ref{fig:social-max}b. Since electricity demand is highly inelastic,
economic dispatch models minimize the cost of generating electricity.
\textcolor{black}{Although optimizing welfare, rather than the total cost, is
useful for disaggregating multiple demands for the same commodity
\cite{leuthold_elmod_2008}, this thesis adopts the former, simplified, approach
to economic dispatch.}

\subsection{Accounting for Uncertainty}
\label{section:uncertainty}
Due to the complexity of our energy system, handling uncertainty is one of the
most important features for \acp{esom} \cite{yue_review_2018,
decarolis_using_2011}. There are broadly two types of uncertainties: parametric
and structural. The former refers to uncertainty around the value of some
empirical quantity (e.g. price of fuel or the discount rate). In many cases,
these quantities are better represented by \textit{distributions} which may be
sampled using formal methods like \ac{mc} or \ac{pa}
\cite{pfenninger_energy_2014, yue_review_2018}. Deterministic codes such as
TEMOA, TIMES, or ESME use these techniques to generate many model runs. Another
method for handling parametric uncertainty is \ac{sp}, where parameters are
replaced with non-linear risk functions \cite{yue_review_2018,
decarolis_multi-stage_2012}. Although parametric uncertainty is important the
analysis of uncertain values is not a focus of this thesis.

Structural uncertainty relates to \textit{unmodeled objectives}
\cite{yue_review_2018, decarolis_using_2011, decarolis_modelling_2016}. There
are few formal methods to address structural uncertainty due to its qualitative
nature. The most common approach to handling this type of uncertainty is using
\ac{mga} to probe the near-optimal decision space \cite{brill_mga_1990,
jenkins_genx_2022, decarolis_using_2011, neumann_near-optimal_2021,
pfenninger_energy_2014}. DeCarolis wrote, ``[p]olicy-makers often have strong
concerns outside the scope of most models (e.g., political feasibility,
permitting and regulation, and timing of action), which implies that feasible,
sub-optimal solutions may be preferable for reasons that are difficult to
quantify in energy economy optimization models'' \cite{decarolis_using_2011}.
Therefore, an ``optimal solution'' may lie in the model's inferior space
\cite{decarolis_using_2011}. Section \ref{section:mga} details the
implementation of \ac{mga}. \textcolor{black}{However, this approach still
requires an objective function, and the sub-optimal space is still within some
tolerance of the optimal value of the defined optimization space. Further, the solutions generated by \ac{mga}
still admit bias from policy-makers and does not require users to consider the
equity implications of these alternative solutions.} 

Another strategy to handle structural uncertainty is optimizing multiple
objectives simultaneously. However, some researchers dismissed this approach for
the following reasons \cite{decarolis_using_2011}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item structural uncertainty will always exist, regardless of the number of
    modeled objectives;
    \item traditional \ac{moo} enables the exploration of a set of non-dominated
    solutions (i.e., the Pareto-front), but
    not the near-optimal space;
    \item analyzing tradeoffs for problems with many objectives is tedious.
\end{enumerate}
These critiques may explain the distinct lack of frameworks that apply \ac{moo}
for energy system problems. However, there are important benefits to \ac{moo} (
primarily the opportunity to analyze tradeoffs),
and the lack of an energy system \textit{framework} to apply this technique is
one of the gaps this thesis fulfills.
