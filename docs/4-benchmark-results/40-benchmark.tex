\chapter{Benchmark Results}
\label{chapter:benchmark-results}

This chapter first illustrates some of the differences among three evolutionary
algorithms: \ac{nsga2}, \ac{nsga3}, and \ac{unsga3}. Second, this chapter shows 
that solutions calculated by \ac{osier} agree with a more established \ac{esom}, 
\ac{temoa}. Lastly, this chapter demonstrates some of \ac{osier}'s advanced features, 
such as many-objective objective problems and combining \ac{moo} with \ac{mga}.

\section{Exercise 0: Deciding Among Evolutionary Algorithms}

\ac{osier} allows users to choose among a variety of \acp{moo}.

\section{Exercise 1: Exploring objective space}
In the first benchmark exercise, I used \ac{temoa} to calculate the least-cost
solution. Then I generated 30 alternative solutions with \ac{mga} as described
in Section \ref{section:mga} with a 10\% slack variable added to \ac{temoa}'s
objective function. Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-01} shows the points from
\ac{temoa} in red and \ac{osier}'s Pareto-front for the same problem in blue.
The red- and blue-shaded regions are the sub-optimal spaces (i.e., within 10\%
of any objective) for \ac{temoa} and \ac{osier}, respectively.

  \caption{Compares the least-cost solutions between \acs{temoa}
  and \acs{osier} as well as their sub-optimal spaces. The least-cost solutions
  for \ac{osier} and \ac{temoa} are within 0.5\% of each other.}
  \label{fig:temoa-benchmark-01}
\end{figure}

First, \ac{temoa}'s least-cost solution is slightly better (within 0.5\%) than
\ac{osier}'s in terms of both cost and emissions. This happens because
\ac{temoa} optimizes energy dispatch slightly differently than \ac{osier}. In
particular, the initial storage value for energy storage technologies is a
decision variable in \ac{temoa} and not in \ac{osier}. A second reason for this
discrepancy has to do with convergence. \ac{osier}'s Pareto-front could likely
be improved with a lower convergence tolerance, but this would use additional
computational resources.

Next, the sub-optimal spaces partially overlap, indicating that \ac{temoa} could
find a solution with lower carbon emissions after sufficient iterations.
However, none of \ac{temoa}'s \ac{mga} solutions fall within \ac{osier}'s
sub-optimal space. This point highlights the necessity for \acl{moo}. The
objective of \ac{mga} is to produce a \textit{diverse subset} of points in the
sub-optimal region. \ac{mga} may capture appealing alternatives for some
unmodeled objective in the original problem, but it cannot guarantee that those
solutions will be an improvement along any other objective axis. This is
especially apparent here, where the least-cost solution happens also to be the
lowest carbon solution. Even though \ac{moo} reduces structural uncertainty, it
will always exist, as discussed in Section \ref{section:uncertainty}. Therefore,
identifying alternative solutions by sampling points in the inferior region is
still useful. Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-02} shows a set of solutions in
\ac{osier}'s inferior region and some randomly selected points.

Natural gas with \ac{ccs} shows up in the randomly selected points in
\ac{osier}'s sub-optimal region. A geo-political locus for energy
infrastructure, described in Section \ref{section:energy-system-boundaries}
offers one possible explanation for this technology since states with
significant natural gas resources might seek to maintain their influence by
developing low-carbon technology that still uses natural gas.


\section{Exercise 2: Four Simultaneous Objectives}
This exercise minimized four objectives simultaneously: total system cost, 
lifecycle carbon emissions, land-use change, and percentage of total energy
from non-renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources include solar,
wind, and biomass. Although batteries are often used in conjunction with
\acp{vre}, they are not considered ``renewable'' (nor are they a true energy
``source'' since they store energy from other sources rather than producing
their own). Figure \ref{fig:4-obj-pareto} shows the Pareto front for this 4-dimensional problem.

\begin{noteBox}
\textbf{Reading \Aclp{pcp}:}
Visualizing the Pareto front for this problem presents a challenge due to its
high dimensionality. Therefore, I present the results with a novel plot, called
a \ac{pcp}. This plot is helpful for highlighting differences among a small set
of solutions with a potentially large number of dimensions. Figure \ref{fig:4-obj-pareto} 
and Figure \ref{fig:4-obj-design} are both \acp{pcp}. Although \acp{pcp} show continuous
lines, they do not show a ``trend''. That is, for a given solution, each objective
takes on a single value that is plotted on its respective vertical axis. The lines 
connecting these points simply emphasize that these points belong to the same solution.
Additionally, each objective axis has its own upper and lower bound because each objective
is scaled differently.
The \ac{mga} solutions presented in Figure \ref{fig:4-obj-design-mga} using a 
``letter-value'' plot due to the larger number of solutions included in \ac{mga}.

  objective are colored. The gray lines represent solutions on the Pareto front 
  that are not extremum.}
  \label{fig:4-obj-pareto}
\end{figure}

Each of the colored lines in Figure \ref{fig:4-obj-pareto} belongs to a solution with an
`extreme' value on the Pareto-front. For instance, the blue line labeled ``Highest Renewable''
has the lowest percentage of non-renewable energy sources of any solution. The gray lines 
are simply other points along the Pareto-front. Figure \ref{fig:4-obj-pareto} shows that minimizing 
land-use change and renewable energy maximization are strongly competing objectives, since the
other three extremum are grouped together on those two axes and diametrically opposed to the 
``highest renewable'' solution. Figure \ref{fig:4-obj-design} illustrates the design space for
each extreme solution.

Figure \ref{fig:4-obj-design-mga} extends the design space results to include the \ac{mga} solutions. 
This plot indicates the design preferences for a middling solution, but hides the relationship among
energy technologies. The most popular technologies in Figure \ref{fig:4-obj-design-mga} are conventional
nuclear, battery storage, and solar panels. The least popular technologies are wind turbines and ``advanced''
coal plants.
