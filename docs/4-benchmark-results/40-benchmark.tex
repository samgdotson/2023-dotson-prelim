\chapter{Benchmark Results}
\label{chapter:benchmark-results}
\ac{osier} is a key tool that will be leveraged in the analysis of subsequent
work. Accordingly, it must be shown that \ac{osier} generates reproducible and
reliable, results consistent with the results from an established framework.
This chapter has three objectives, the first is to illustrate some of the
differences among three evolutionary algorithms: \ac{nsga2}, \ac{nsga3}, and
\ac{unsga3}. Second, it shows that solutions calculated by \ac{osier} agree with
a more established \ac{esom}, \ac{temoa}. Lastly, it demonstrates some of
\ac{osier}'s advanced features, such as many-objective objective problems and
combining \ac{moo} with \ac{mga}.

\section{Exercise 0: Deciding Among Evolutionary Algorithms}

\ac{osier} allows users to choose among a variety of \ac{moo} methods. This is
motivated by the desire for flexibility. However, Exercises 1 and 2 use just one
algorithm, \ac{unsga3} as implemented by \ac{pymoo}, which should be justified
by comparing the results against different algorithms. As an important aside,
although I used the \ac{deap} implementations of \ac{nsga2} and \ac{nsga3},
these algorithms are not exclusive to \ac{deap}. \ac{pymoo} also implements
them, I simply wanted to show the breadth of support for different tools in
\ac{osier}. Figure \ref{fig:algorithm-comparison} provides the justification for
choosing \ac{unsga3} by comparing the results of three \ac{moo} algorithms by
showing the respective scatter plots and a density plot of the points on each
axis. Since it took \ac{unsga3} 128 generations to reach its convergence
criterion, the other two algorithms were also stopped after 128 generations,
before converging. The density plot above the scatter plot shows the density of
points along the ``total cost'' objective. Similarly, the density plot to the
right shows the distribution of points for the ``emissions'' objective.

There are a few notable features of Figure \ref{fig:algorithm-comparison}.
First, all three algorithms identified very similar Pareto fronts, the main
differences involve the distribution of points and the extent of their
respective solution sets. Second, the two \ac{deap} algorithms have a greater
number of points along the bottom part of the Pareto front, indicating a greater
sampling over the cost objective. This is further supported by the higher
concentration of points along the lower half of the emission objective's range.
Third, the algorithms implemented by \ac{deap} both have more extreme values
along both axes. All of these features can be attributed to the fact that
neither \ac{nsga2} nor \ac{nsga3} fully converged. Thus, choosing \ac{unsga3}
will be used for the remaining exercises for its faster convergence.

\section{Exercise 1: Exploring objective space}
Since structural uncertainty persists regardless of the number of objectives
used, it's important to check the near-optimal objective space for alternative
solutions. In the first benchmark exercise, I used \ac{temoa} to calculate the
least-cost solution. Then I generated 30 alternative solutions with \ac{mga} as
described in Section \ref{section:mga} with a 10\% slack variable added to
\ac{temoa}'s objective function. Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-01} shows the
points from \ac{temoa} in red and \ac{osier}'s Pareto-front for the same problem
in blue. The red- and blue-shaded regions are the sub-optimal spaces (i.e.,
within 10\% of any objective) for \ac{temoa} and \ac{osier}, respectively.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  % \resizebox{0.6\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/results/temoa_osier_benchmark_01.pgf}}

  \caption{Compares the least-cost solutions between \acs{temoa}
  and \acs{osier} as well as their sub-optimal spaces. The least-cost solutions
  for \ac{osier} and \ac{temoa} are within 0.5\% of each other.}
  \label{fig:temoa-benchmark-01}
\end{figure}

First, \ac{temoa}'s least-cost solution is slightly better (within 0.5\%) than
\ac{osier}'s in terms of both cost and emissions. This happens because
\ac{temoa} optimizes energy dispatch slightly differently than \ac{osier}. In
particular, the initial storage value for energy storage technologies is a
decision variable in \ac{temoa} and not in \ac{osier}. A second reason for this
discrepancy has to do with convergence. \ac{osier}'s Pareto-front could likely
be improved with a lower convergence tolerance, but this would use additional
computational resources. Although, \ac{temoa} calculated an optimal solution
with slightly lower cost than \ac{osier}, modelers should not place too much
importance on this fact because \acp{esom} should be used to generate insight
rather than answers, due to the nature of the systems being modeled
\cite{decarolis_using_2011}.

Next, the sub-optimal spaces mostly overlap, indicating that \ac{temoa} could
find a solution with lower carbon emissions after sufficient iterations.
However, none of \ac{temoa}'s \ac{mga} solutions fall within \ac{osier}'s
sub-optimal space. This point highlights the necessity for \acl{moo}. The
objective of \ac{mga} is to produce a \textit{diverse subset} of points in the
sub-optimal region. \ac{mga} may capture appealing alternatives for some
unmodeled objective in the original problem, but it cannot guarantee that those
solutions will be an improvement along any other objective axis. This is
especially apparent here, where the least-cost solution happens also to be the
lowest carbon solution, for \ac{temoa}. The relatively small area where the two
\acp{esom} do not overlap is fully explained by the difference in their
least-cost solutions.

Even though \ac{moo} reduces structural uncertainty, it will always exist, as
discussed in Section \ref{section:uncertainty}. Therefore, identifying
alternative solutions by sampling points in the inferior region is still useful.
Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-02} focuses on the near-optimal space presented
in \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-01} and shows both the complete set of near-optimal
solutions (green) and some randomly selected points, highlighted in red.

\end{figure}

Both Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-01} and Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-02}
present solutions in the objective space. However, in order to be prescriptive,
the policy solutions must be formulated according to the decision space. In
other words, described according to the mix of technologies that produced a
solution. Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-03} presents the spread of results in
the decision space for each model. Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-03}a shows
the spread of each technology present in \ac{osier}'s Pareto front. Figure
\ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-03}b shows the same, but also includes the randomly
selected points from \ac{osier}'s near-optimal space. Lastly, Figure
\ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-03}c shows the same kind of distribution for
\ac{temoa}'s \ac{mga} solutions. Presented in this way, the design space results
indicate which technologies are always or usually present. Technologies that are
absent in all cases, including the near-optimal solutions, may be safely
ignored. For \ac{osier}, these technologies include both types of coal, biomass,
and largely ignores wind energy. In \ac{temoa}'s results, there are no
technologies that are totally absent. This result is due to the imperative built
into standard \ac{mga} to identify solutions that are maximally different in
design space, whereas \ac{osier} randomly selected points in its inferior
region. This suggests one avenue for improving \ac{osier}.

\section{Exercise 2: Four Simultaneous Objectives}
Chapter \ref{chapter:lit-review} showed that conventional \acp{esom} virtually
always model a single objective and that objective is uniformly cost (or a
similar aggregated economic indicator). Further, Section
\ref{section:moo-in-energy} showed that the existing literature employing
\ac{moo} never model more than three objectives simultaneously. The purpose of
this final exercise is to demonstrate that \ac{osier} can optimize many
objectives, thereby providing more context and confidence for the tool. This
exercise minimized four objectives simultaneously: total system cost, lifecycle
carbon emissions, land-use change, and percentage of total energy from
non-renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources include solar, wind, and
biomass. Although batteries are often used in conjunction with \acp{vre}, they
are not considered ``renewable'' (nor are they a true energy ``source'' since
they store energy from other sources rather than producing their own). For
clarity, the ``percent non-renewable'' objective refers to the penetration of
non-renewable sources as a percentage of the energy produced rather than as a
percentage of the systems total installed capacity. Figure
\ref{fig:4-obj-pareto} shows the objective-space Pareto front for this
4-dimensional problem.

\begin{noteBox}
\textbf{Reading \Aclp{pcp}:} Visualizing the Pareto front for this problem
presents a challenge due to its high dimensionality. Therefore, I present the
results with a novel plot, called a \ac{pcp}. This plot is helpful for
highlighting differences among a small set of solutions with a potentially large
number of dimensions. Figure \ref{fig:4-obj-pareto} and Figure
\ref{fig:4-obj-design} are both \acp{pcp}. Although \acp{pcp} show continuous
lines, they do not show a ``trend''. That is, for a given solution, each
objective takes on a single value that is plotted on its respective vertical
axis. The lines connecting these points simply emphasize that these points
belong to the same solution. Additionally, each objective axis has its own upper
and lower bound because each objective is scaled differently. The \ac{mga}
solutions presented in Figure \ref{fig:4-obj-design-mga} using a boxplot due to
the larger number of solutions included in \ac{mga}.

  \caption{The Pareto front for a four objective problem. Extreme values for
  each objective are colored. The gray lines represent solutions on the Pareto
  front that are not extremum.}
  \label{fig:4-obj-pareto}
\end{figure}

Each of the colored lines in Figure \ref{fig:4-obj-pareto} belongs to a solution
with an `extreme' value on the Pareto-front. For instance, the blue line labeled
``Highest Renewable'' has the lowest percentage of non-renewable energy sources
of any solution. The gray lines are simply other points along the Pareto-front.
Figure \ref{fig:4-obj-pareto} shows that minimizing land-use change and
renewable energy maximization are strongly competing objectives, since the other
three extremum are grouped together on those two axes and diametrically opposed
to the ``highest renewable'' solution. Figure \ref{fig:4-obj-design} illustrates
the design space for each extreme solution.

  \caption{The design space for a four objective problem.}
  \label{fig:4-obj-design}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:4-obj-design} shows that conventional coal and advanced coal
technologies are largely uninteresting because they make up at most 7\% and 4\%
of a solution's peak demand, respectively. The ``highest renewable'' solution
achieves its goal of reaching approximately 100\% renewable energy (by
percentage of energy produced) with a significant overbuild of wind energy and
batteries, with natural gas and a small amount of coal for reliability.
Interestingly, this solution uses no solar energy, even though solar and wind
are frequently assumed to complement each other.

Figure \ref{fig:4-obj-design-mga} extends the design space results to include
the \ac{mga} solutions. This plot indicates the design preferences for a
middling solution, but hides the relationship among energy technologies. The
most popular technologies in Figure \ref{fig:4-obj-design-mga} are conventional
nuclear, battery storage, and solar panels. The least popular technologies are
wind turbines, biomass, and ``advanced'' coal plants.
