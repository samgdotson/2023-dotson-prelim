\chapter{Benchmark Results}
\label{chapter:benchmark-results}

This chapter shows that solutions calculated by \ac{osier} agree with a more
established \ac{esom}, \ac{temoa}, and demonstrates some \ac{osier}'s advanced
features, such as many-objective objective problems and combining \ac{moo} with
\ac{mga}.

\section{Exercise 1: Exploring objective space}
In the first benchmark exercise, I used \ac{temoa} to calculate the least-cost
solution. Then I generated 30 alternative solutions with \ac{mga} as described
in Section \ref{section:mga} with a 10\% slack variable added to \ac{temoa}'s
objective function. Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-01} shows the points from
\ac{temoa} in red and \ac{osier}'s Pareto-front for the same problem in blue.
The red- and blue-shaded regions are the sub-optimal spaces (i.e., within 10\%
of any objective) for \ac{temoa} and \ac{osier}, respectively.

  and \acs{osier} as well as their sub-optimal spaces. The least-cost solutions
  for \ac{osier} and \ac{temoa} are within 0.5\% of each other.}
  \label{fig:temoa-benchmark-01}
\end{figure}

First, \ac{temoa}'s least-cost solution is slightly better (within 0.5\%) than
\ac{osier}'s in terms of both cost and emissions. This happens because
\ac{temoa} optimizes energy dispatch slightly differently than \ac{osier}. In
particular, the initial storage value for energy storage technologies is a
decision variable in \ac{temoa} and not in \ac{osier}. A second reason for this
discrepancy has to do with convergence. \ac{osier}'s Pareto-front could likely
be improved with a lower convergence tolerance, but this would use additional
computational resources.

Next, the sub-optimal spaces partially overlap, indicating that \ac{temoa} could
find a solution with lower carbon emissions after sufficient iterations.
However, none of \ac{temoa}'s \ac{mga} solutions fall within \ac{osier}'s
sub-optimal space. This point highlights the necessity for \acl{moo}. The
objective of \ac{mga} is to produce a \textit{diverse subset} of points in the
sub-optimal region. \ac{mga} may capture appealing alternatives for some
unmodeled objective in the original problem, but it cannot guarantee that those
solutions will be an improvement along any other objective axis. This is
especially apparent here, where the least-cost solution happens also to be the
lowest carbon solution. Even though \ac{moo} reduces structural uncertainty, it
will always exist, as discussed in Section \ref{section:uncertainty}. Therefore,
identifying alternative solutions by sampling points in the inferior region is
still useful. Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-02} shows a set of solutions in
\ac{osier}'s inferior region and some randomly selected points.

  generated by \ac{temoa}'s \ac{mga} algorithm shown in Figure
  \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-01}.}

Natural gas with \ac{ccs} shows up in the randomly selected points in
\ac{osier}'s sub-optimal region. A geo-political locus for energy
infrastructure, described in Section \ref{section:energy-system-boundaries}
offers one possible explanation for this technology since states with
significant natural gas resources might seek to maintain their influence by
developing low-carbon technology that still uses natural gas.
