	abstract = {We utilize a newly developed framework called Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis (Temoa) to perform multi-stage stochastic optimization of a simple energy system. The system consists of 27 technologies used to supply primary energy resources, refine petroleum products, generate electricity, and serve end use demands. The model considers stochastic crude oil and natural gas prices over 4 time periods, resulting in a total of 256 scenarios. Model results indicate that future changes in oil price may have a larger effect on system cost than natural gas prices, but overall the system configuration requires little recourse as fuel price uncertainty is revealed over time. This analysis represents an early step towards our goal of applying stochastic optimization in a high performance computing environment to develop robust, near-term hedging strategies for energy system management.},

In this paper, we do so by employing an existing optimization technique called modeling to generate alternatives ({MGA}), which involves a change in the model structure in order to systematically explore the near-optimal decision space. The {MGA} capability is incorporated into Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis (Temoa), an open source framework that also includes a technology rich, bottom up {ESOM}. In this analysis, Temoa is used to explore alternative energy futures in a simplified single region energy system that represents the U.S. electric sector and a portion of the light duty transport sector. Given the dataset limitations, we place greater emphasis on the methodological approach rather than specific results.},

	abstract = {Energy-economy optimization models - encoded with a set of structured, self-consistent assumptions and decision rules - have emerged as a key tool for the analysis of energy and climate policy at the national and international scale. Given the expansive system boundaries and multi-decadal timescales involved, addressing future uncertainty in these models is a critical challenge. The approach taken by many modelers is to build larger models with greater complexity to deal with structural uncertainty, and run a few highly detailed scenarios under different input assumptions to address parametric uncertainty. The result is often large and inflexible models used to conduct analysis that offers little insight. This paper introduces a technique borrowed from the operations research literature called modeling to generate alternatives ({MGA}) as a way to flex energy models and systematically explore the feasible, near-optimal solution space in order to develop alternatives that are maximally different in decision space but perform well with regard to the modeled objectives. The resultant {MGA} alternatives serve a useful role by challenging preconceptions and highlighting plausible alternative futures. A simple, conceptual model of the U.S. electric sector is presented to demonstrate the utility of {MGA} as an energy modeling technique.},

Community microgrids are, however, complex to implement and institutional change is needed to reach their full potential. The purpose of this article is to review existing literature and analyze institutional developments influencing the growth of community microgrids. The literature describes a concentration of microgrid activities in specific regions: {USA}, {EU}, Asia and Australia. Varying reasons for implementing community microgrids were found in the different regions but similar institutional developments occurred, albeit with differing emphasis due to contextual specificities. Formal directions do however influence informal institutions even though their aims differ. Power utilities stand out as a critical actor and both formal and informal institutions put pressure on utilities to update their traditional business models. This article illustrates how informal and formal institutions play a significant role in the growth of community microgrids in existing electricity grids and provide interesting examples which can be utilized by policymakers. Microgrid development is still in a formative phase and further institutional change in the form of updated regulations is needed.},

However, with the evolution of software systems, cost reductions in energy technology, and increasing customer drive for sustainability, reliability, resilience, and cost predictability, microgrids have become more capable today and have experienced a surge in deployment. Make no mistake, the growth is customer driven. So, what does the future hold for microgrids? If customers continue to seek cost predictability, sustainability, and reliability/resilience in their energy services, then long-term growth in the microgrid industry should be obvious, even in the face of resistance from utilities and policymakers. Where will microgrids be in 2035? 2050? Will utilities embrace microgrids? Will policymakers become facilitators of microgrids? Will municipalities and rural cooperatives use microgrids to hedge costs and improve sustainability and resilience for their citizens/members? This article will discuss the trends and drivers stemming from the early days of microgrids that still exist today which likely lead to an institutionalization and growth of microgrids in the future.},

While the number of model-based analyses proliferates, insufficient attention is paid to transparency in model development and application. Given the complex, data-intensive nature of {EEO} models and the general lack of access to source code and data, many of the assumptions underlying model-based analysis are hidden from external observers. This paper discusses the simplifications and subjective judgments involved in the model building process, which cannot be fully articulated in journal papers, reports, or model documentation. In addition, we argue that for all practical purposes, {EEO} model-based insights cannot be validated through comparison to real world outcomes. As a result, modelers are left without credible metrics to assess a model's ability to deliver reliable insight. We assert that {EEO} models should be discoverable through interrogation of publicly available source code and data. In addition, third parties should be able to run a specific model instance in order to independently verify published results. Yet a review of twelve {EEO} models suggests that in most cases, replication of model results is currently impossible. We provide several recommendations to help develop and sustain a software framework for repeatable model analysis.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis (Temoa), an open source framework for conducting energy system analysis. The core component of Temoa is an energy economy optimization ({EEO}) model, which minimizes the system-wide cost of energy supply by optimizing the deployment and utilization of energy technologies over a user-specified time horizon. The design of Temoa is intended to fill a unique niche within the energy modeling landscape by addressing two critical shortcomings associated with existing models: an inability to perform third party verification of published model results and the difficulty of conducting uncertainty analysis with large, complex models. Temoa leverages a modern revision control system to publicly archive model source code and data, which ensures repeatability of all published modeling work. From its initial conceptualization, Temoa was also designed for operation within a high performance computing environment to enable rigorous uncertainty analysis. We present the algebraic formulation of Temoa and conduct a verification exercise by implementing a simple test system in both Temoa
and {MARKAL}, a widely used commercial model of the same type. In addition, a stochastic optimization of the test system is presented as a proof-of-concept application of uncertainty analysis using the Temoa framework.},

First, we identify key criteria for analyzing current {ESMs} and we describe seven current and future low-carbon energy system modeling challenges: the increasing need for flexibility, further electrification, emergence of new technologies, technological learning and efficiency improvements, decentralization, macroeconomic interactions, and the role of social behavior in the energy system transition. These criteria are then translated into required modeling capabilities such as the need for hourly temporal resolution, sectoral coupling technologies (e.g., P2X), technological learning, flexibility technologies, stakeholder behavior, cross border trade, and linking with macroeconomic models. Second, a Multi-Criteria Analysis ({MCA}) is used as a framework to identify modeling gaps while clarifying high modeling capabilities of {MARKAL}, {TIMES}, {REMix}, {PRIMES}, and {METIS}. Third, to bridge major energy modeling gaps, two conceptual modeling suites are suggested, based on both optimization and simulation methodologies, in which the integrated {ESM} is hard-linked with a regional model and an energy market model and soft-linked with a macroeconomic model.,

Understanding features that persist across many cost-efficient alternatives enhances policy advice and acknowledges structural model uncertainties. We apply the modeling-to-generate-alternatives ({MGA}) methodology to systematically explore the near-optimal feasible space of a completely renewable European electricity system model. While accounting for complex spatio-temporal patterns, we allow simultaneous capacity expansion of generation, storage and transmission infrastructure subject to linearized multi-period optimal power flow. Many similarly costly, but technologically diverse solutions exist. Already a cost deviation of 0.5\% offers a large range of possible investments. However, either offshore or onshore wind energy along with some hydrogen storage and transmission network reinforcement appear essential to keep costs within 10\% of the optimum.},

	abstract = {Electrical energy storage could play an important role in decarbonizing the electricity sector by offering a new, carbon-free source of operational flexibility, improving the utilization of generation assets, and facilitating the integration of variable renewable energy sources. Yet, the future cost of energy storage technologies is uncertain, and the value that they can bring to the system depends on multiple factors. Moreover, the marginal value of storage diminishes as more energy storage capacity is deployed. To explore the potential value of energy storage in deep decarbonization of the electricity sector, we assess the impact of increasing levels of energy storage capacity on both power system operations and investments in generation capacity using a generation capacity expansion model with detailed unit commitment constraints. In a case study of a system with load and renewable resource characteristics from the U.S. state of Texas, we find that energy storage delivers value by increasing the cost-effective penetration of renewable energy, reducing total investments in nuclear power and gas-fired peaking units, and improving the utilization of all installed capacity. However, we find that the value delivered by energy storage with a 2-hour storage capacity only exceeds current technology costs under strict emissions limits, implying that substantial cost reductions in battery storage are needed to justify large-scale deployment. In contrast, storage resources with a 10-hour storage capacity deliver value consistent with the current cost of pumped hydroelectric storage. In general, while energy storage appears essential to enable decarbonization strategies dependent on very high shares of wind and solar energy, storage is not a requisite if a diverse mix of flexible, low-carbon power sources is employed, including flexible nuclear power.},

However, there is a concern that the uncertainties inherent in the model structures and input parameters are at best underplayed and at worst ignored. Compared to other types of energy models, {ESOMs} tend to use scenarios to handle uncertainties or treat them as a marginal issue. Without adequately addressing uncertainties, the model insights may be limited, lack robustness, and may mislead decision makers. This paper provides an in-depth review of systematic techniques that address uncertainties for {ESOMs}. We have identiﬁed four prevailing uncertainty approaches that have been applied to {ESOM} type models: Monte Carlo analysis, stochastic programming, robust optimization, and modelling to generate alternatives. For each method, we review the principles, techniques, and how they are utilized to improve the robustness of the model results to provide extra policy insights. In the end, we provide a critical appraisal on the use of these methods.},

Electricity system planning at the monthly timescale can be improved by adapting climate forecasts to estimate electricity demand and utilizing energy models to estimate monthly electricity generation and associated operational costs. The objective of this paper is to develop and test a computationally efficient model that can support seasonal planning while preserving key aspects of system operation over hourly and daily timeframes. To do so, an energy system optimization model is repurposed for seasonal planning using features drawn from a unit commitment model. Different scenarios utilizing a well-known test system are used to evaluate the errors associated with both the repurposed energy system model and an imperfect load forecast. The results show that the energy system optimization model using an imperfect load forecast produces differences in monthly cost and generation levels that are less than 2\% compared with a unit commitment model using a perfect load forecast. The enhanced energy system optimization model can be solved approximately 100 times faster than the unit commitment model, making it a suitable tool for future work aimed at evaluating seasonal electricity generation and demand under uncertainty.},

However, increased risk of extreme weather events from climate change has proven more difficult to model. Here, we present an energy system optimization model that incorporates hurricane risks by combining storm probabilities with infrastructure fragility curves, and demonstrate its utility in the context of Puerto Rico, an island territory of the United States that had its energy system severely damaged by Hurricane Maria in 2017. The model assesses the potential to change grid architecture, fuel mix and grid hardening measures considering hurricane impacts as well as climate mitigation policies. When hurricane trends are included, 2040 electricity cost projections increase by 32\% based on historical hurricane frequencies and by 82\% for increased hurricane frequencies. Transitioning to renewables and natural gas reduces costs and emissions independent of climate mitigation policies.},

	abstract = {Studies focusing on 100\% renewable energy systems have emerged in recent years; however, existing studies tend to focus only on the power sector using exploratory approaches. This paper therefore undertakes a whole-system approach and explores optimal pathways towards 100\% renewable energy by 2050. The analysis is carried out for Ireland, which currently has the highest share of variable renewable electricity on a synchronous power system. Large numbers of scenarios are developed using the Irish {TIMES} model to address uncertainties. Results show that compared to decarbonization targets, focusing on renewable penetration without considering carbon capture options is significantly less cost effective in carbon mitigation. Alternative assumptions on bioenergy imports and maximum variability in power generation lead to very different energy mixes in bioenergy and electrification levels. All pathways suggest that indigenous bioenergy needs to be fully exploited and the current annual deployment rate of renewable electricity needs a boost. Pathways relying on international bioenergy imports are slightly cheaper and faces less economic and technical challenges. However, given the large future uncertainties, it is recommended that further policy considerations be given to pathways with high electrification levels as they are more robust towards uncertainties.},

At the core of this task is the switch to 100\% renewables across all sectors on the same time horizon. Conventional technologies fueled by fossil and nuclear energies are, according to the vast majority of current cost calculations, energetically inefficient, too expensive, and too slow in expansion to be able to deliver a substantial contribution to rapid climate protection. We present the first comprehensive energy scenario that shows the way to 100\% renewable energy for all energy sectors by 2030. The result of the calculations is a cost-effective energy system that is compatible with the German share of necessary greenhouse gas reduction. This study shows a target system of generation, conversion, and storage technologies that can achieve the transformation to 100\% renewable energy in all energy sectors—electricity, heat, and mobility—in time and at competitive costs below the costs of the current system. Moreover, we demonstrate the huge cost effect that arises if southern Germany renounces its onshore wind resources and find that this would substantially increase the need for high-voltage direct-current transmission capacity.},

	abstract = {In the face of the broad political call for an “energy turnaround”, we are currently witnessing three essential trends with regard to energy infrastructure planning, energy generation and storage: from planned production towards fluctuating production on the basis of renewable energy sources, from centralized generation towards decentralized generation and from expensive energy carriers towards cost-free energy carriers. These changes necessitate considerable modifications of the energy infrastructure. Even though most of these modifications are inherently motivated by geospatial questions and challenges, the integration of energy system models and Geographic Information Systems ({GIS}) is still in its infancy. This paper analyzes the shortcomings of previous approaches in using {GIS} in renewable energy-related projects, extracts distinct challenges from these previous efforts and, finally, defines a set of core future research avenues for {GIS}-based energy infrastructure planning with a focus on the use of renewable energy. These future research avenues comprise the availability base data and their “geospatial awareness”, the development of a generic and unified data model, the usage of volunteered geographic information ({VGI}) and crowdsourced data in analysis processes, the integration of 3D building models and 3D data analysis, the incorporation of network topologies into {GIS}, the harmonization of the heterogeneous views on aggregation issues in the fields of energy and {GIS}, fine-grained energy demand estimation from freely-available data sources, decentralized storage facility planning, the investigation of {GIS}-based public participation mechanisms, the transition from purely structural to operational planning, data privacy aspects and, finally, the development of a new dynamic power market design.},

In planning, this change is reflected by applying optimization models to regions within a country to optimize the distribution of generation units and to evaluate the resulting impact on the grid topology. This paper proposes a globally applicable framework to find a suitable regionalization for energy system models with a data-driven approach. Based on a global, spatially resolved database of demand, generation, and renewable profiles, hierarchical clustering with fine-tuning is performed. This regionalization approach is applied by modeling the resulting regions in an optimization model including a synthesized grid. In an exemplary case study, South Africa’s energy system is examined. The results show that the data-driven regionalization is beneficial compared to the common approach of using political regions. Furthermore, the results of a modeled 80\% decarbonization until 2045 demonstrate that the integration of renewable energy sources fundamentally changes the role of regions within South Africa’s energy system. Thereby, the electricity exchange between regions is also impacted, leading to a different grid topology. Using clustered regions improves the understanding and analysis of regional transformations in the decarbonization process.},

Other justice issues relate to extensive contamination in the U.S. nuclear weapons complex, and the mining and processing industries that have supported it. To approach the topic, first we discuss distributional justice issues of {NPP} sites in the U.S. and related procedural injustices in siting, operation, and emergency preparedness. Then we discuss justice concerns involving the U.S. nuclear weapons complex and the ways that uranium mining, processing, and weapons development have affected those living downwind, including a substantial American Indian population. Next we examine the problem of high-level nuclear waste and the risk implications of the lack of secure long-term storage. The handling and deposition of toxic nuclear wastes pose new transgenerational justice issues of unprecedented duration, in comparison to any other industry. Finally, we discuss the persistent risks of nuclear technologies and renewable energy alternatives.},

                  The premise of this Viewpoint article is that the sustainability of the electricity supply is very often addressed in narrow frames of reference, which sets up incremental decision-making. To more fairly compare the economic, social, and environmental aspects of renewables, such as photovoltaics, to fossil fuels, a broader view is required which needs to take into account the impacts of the fossil fuel supply chain.
               
            
            February 2016 was the warmest February since record keeping began in 1880, and was the warmest month in recorded history (in terms of its deviation from average). May 2016, the warmest May on record, was the 13th consecutive record-breaking month. The Paris Agreement signed in December 2015 has solidified agreement that the world must address climate change, and has resounded the warning that inaction on climate change carries potentially catastrophic risk for the global economy. Electricity generated from renewable energy sources is often compared to fossil fuel energy in terms of economics. Recently there have also been increased calls to incorporate the external costs of electricity generation into the price of electricity. Fossil fuels are largely responsible for global warming (as 85\% of the {CO}2 emissions come from fossil fuel combustion). This Viewpoint article looks at fuel supply chains for oil \& gas, coal, and nuclear in terms of their economics, environmental and social consequences. This reflection upon the historical and present fossil fuel supply chain gives a perspective useful in avoiding limited frames of reference when addressing the consequences of the business-as-usual operation of fossil fuel supply chains.},

Regardless of politics, many coal-fired electric plants have already been shut down and many utilities are vowing to retire their current coal-fired assets within the next two decades. Replacement power assets require consideration of appropriate siting. A geographic information system ({GIS})-based multicriteria decision analysis approach is useful to assist utility and energy companies, as well as policymakers, to evaluate potential areas for siting new plants in the contiguous United States. A {GIS}-based framework is simply a database of location information that allows for mapping, querying, modeling, and analyzing data based on location. The spatial output can be structured to be visual, allowing for easier analysis of location data. The need to site additional power assets, including renewable resources and clean power sources, such as nuclear, led to the development of the Oak Ridge Siting Analysis for power Generation Expansion ({OR}-{SAGE}) tool discussed in this paper. The tool takes inputs such as population growth, water availability, environmental indicators, and tec­ tonic and geological hazards to provide an in-depth visual analysis for siting options. Energy companies and other stakeholders can use {OR}-{SAGE} to procure feedback quickly and effectively on land suitability based on technology specific inputs. Policymakers can use {OR}-{SAGE} to analyze the impacts of future energy technology decisions, while balancing competing resource use. This paper discusses the recent use of {OR}-{SAGE} for these purposes and plans for future development.},

Focusing particularly upon the contestation over nuclear energy, it challenges eco-modernist claims that technological innovation can bypass political disagreement and smoothly facilitate the shift to a more sustainable form of life in an era of ecological crisis. The article advocates an “ecological agonistic” approach that refuses to regard such contestation as an impediment to robust and radical transformation. Instead, it suggests that the conflicts over nuclear energy reveal the limitations and lacunae of existing social, economic, and political institutions and thus can be understood as themselves playing a salutary role in their transformation.},

	abstract = {Community-based energy systems are gaining traction among policymakers and practitioners as promising models for implementing a low-carbon energy transition. As a result, there has been a proliferation of concepts in the scientific literature, such as community energy, energy communities, community solar, and community wind. However, what scholars mean by “community” in these contexts is often unclear and inconsistent. This paper provides further conceptual clarity in the field by analyzing how the term of community is conceptualized in the scholarly literature on energy systems, through a systematic review of 405 articles. We combine an author keyword network analysis of this corpus with an in-depth analysis of 183 definitions extracted from these articles and systematically coded across three dimensions: meanings, activities and objectives of communities. Our findings show that the meanings attached to the notion of community and the alleged objectives pursued by communities vary substantially across concepts and over time. In particular, there has been a shift away from a notion of community understood as a process that emphasizes participatory aspects toward a notion of com­ munity primarily referring to a place. Furthermore, there is a growing focus on communities’ economic objec­ tives rather than their social or political goals. These findings suggest a weakening of scholars’ attention to “transformative” notions of community emphasizing collective and grassroots processes of participation in en­ ergy transitions, to the benefit of “instrumental” notions. This trend runs the risk of placing the sole emphasis on the market value of communities, thereby diluting their distinctiveness from more commercial actors.},

With the growth in small and medium-sized agents using solar photovoltaic panels, smart meters, vehicle-to-grid electric automobiles, home batteries and other ‘smart’ devices, prosuming offers the potential for consumers and vehicle owners to re-evaluate their energy practices. As the number of prosumers increases, the electric utility sector of today is likely to undergo significant changes over the coming decades, offering possibilities for greening of the system, but also bringing many unknowns and risks that need to be identified and managed. To develop strategies for the future, policymakers and planners need knowledge of how prosumers could be integrated effectively and efficiently into competitive electricity markets. Here we identify and discuss three promising potential prosumer markets related to prosumer grid integration, peer-to-peer models and prosumer community groups. We also caution against optimism by laying out a series of caveats and complexities.},

Firstly, it adds investment models into the review which have not been previously reviewed for decentralized energy modeling. Secondly, a modeling framework consisting of four building blocks is proposed that covers model conceptualization and model operationalization. Thirdly, the relationship between trading mechanisms and model methods is revealed using four evaluation criteria. Furthermore, by reviewing the papers, several trends in the literature are found. Operational models and local markets have been extensively studied, while wholesale market integration and investment models lack scientific attention. Among different trading mechanisms, the usage of bilateral contracts is most commonly seen. Lastly, optimization models significantly outnumber other model methods, and then it follows that their pitfalls such as the scalability of the model and the existence of stable outcomes need to be further addressed in future research.},

From this material, it analyzes such visions based on rhetorical features such as common problems and functions, storylines, discursive struggles, and rhetorical effectiveness.

The article is motivated by the premise that tackling climate change via low-carbon energy systems (and practices) is one of the most significant challenges of the twenty-first century, and that effective decarbonization will require not only new energy technologies, but also new ways of understanding language, visions, and discursive politics surrounding emerging innovations and transitions.},

Cities are promising leverage points to facilitate system transitions by promoting local innovation and policy experimentation. Building on transition management, we developed a knowledge base for the imple­ mentation of transition experiments to reduce city-level car use. From screening nearly 800 peer-reviewed studies and case studies, including in-depth analysis of 24 documents that met quality criteria and quantita­ tively estimated car use reduction, we identify 12 intervention types combining different measures and policy instruments that were effective in reducing car use in European cities. The most effective at reducing overall car use were the Congestion Charge, Parking \& Traffic Congrol, and Limited Traffic Zone. Most interventions were led by local government, planned and decided in collaboration with different urban stakeholders. We evaluated the potential of the identified intervention types to be implemented in a pilot study of Lund, Sweden, using three criteria from Transition Management of novelty, feasibility, and suitability, as assessed by interviews with local experts. We recommend three transition experiments to reduce local car use in Lund: Parking and Traffic Control, Workplace Parking Charge, and Mobility Services for Commuters. We suggest practitioners follow our method to identify effective and locally suitable interventions to reduce car use, and future research quantify the effec­ tiveness of interventions to reduce car use using the standardised outcome measure of daily passenger kilometres travelled by car.},

	abstract = {The objective of the paper is to study the potential behaviour of a power system with high share of nuclear and less thermal plants, in which variable {RES} insertion increases − for example the French case −, in order to determine the specifications for the design of a potential nuclear reactor with high “manoeuvrability”. Moreover, the flexible reactor may participate more in the supply − demand balance and in particular during large frequency fluctuations caused by the high variability of {RES}. The studies are carried out with the {PowerFactory} software, which make it possible to highlight specific needs regarding the power ramp for an “ideal” flexible nuclear reactor. Using a benchmark network, the Kundur “2 areas-4 machines”, the flexibility requirements are obtained as a function of the grid disturbances. For this purpose, the penetration of variable {RES} is progressively increased, while nuclear power is reduced and thermal power plants are totally suppressed. The study shows that a drop in {RES} production directly impacts the minimal frequency. A faster response speed of nuclear power makes it possible to restore this stability and return to normal operating conditions imposed by the grid operator. This paper describes therefore the process of obtaining the flexibility criterion for different cases of insertion of variable {RES}.},

	abstract = {A distributed energy resource ({DER}) system, which can be defined as a medium or small energy conversion and utilization system with various functions for meeting multiple targets, is directly oriented towards users and achieves on-site production and energy supply according to users’ demands. Optimization research on system construction has recently become an important issue. In this paper, simple stochastic mathematical equations were used to interpret the optimal design problem of a {DER} system, and based on this, a novel method for solving the optimization problem, which has multi-dimensional stochastic uncertainties (involving the price of input-energy and energy supply and demand), was put forward. A mixed-integer linear programming ({MILP}) model was established for the optimal design of the {DER} system by combining the ideas of mean value and variance, aiming to minimize the total costs, including facility costs, energy purchase costs, and loss caused by energy supply shortage, and considering the energy balance and facility performance constraints. In the end, a {DER} system design for an office building district in Xuzhou, China, was taken as an example to verify the model. The influences of uncertainty on the selection of system facilities and the economic evaluation were analyzed. The result indicated that uncertainty of energy demand played a significant role in optimal design, whereas energy price played a negligible role. With respect to economy, if uncertainties are not considered in system design, it will result in a short supply, and therefore the total cost will increase considerably. The calculation convergence was compared with previous work. The implementation results showed the practicality and efficiency of the proposed method.},

These conditions drive the need for peak-load power generation, while regulation requirements fuel the push for flexible power generation. The increase of variable renewable energy in the market share, along with falling natural gas prices, makes nuclear power plants less competitive. Thermal storage is being considered to increase the nuclear power plant revenue. Thermal storage increases the flexibility of the nuclear plant system without sacrificing its efficiency. There are multiple opportunities to increase the nuclear power plant revenue, including increased capacity payments, arbitrage, and ancillary services. An economic analysis was performed to investigate the revenue increase of the system with thermal storage. The investment cost was assessed, and net present value was evaluated for the considered scenarios. Two system designs were considered in the analysis: a thermal storage system using the existing power conversion infrastructure and an integrated design with thermal storage fully incorporated into the reactor system design. The preliminary analysis showed that introducing a thermal storage system is profitable for some scenarios considered. Profitability depends significantly on the storage size, output flexibility, share of variable renewable energy, and market characteristics.},

However, the cost of renewable energy technologies and the reliability of a multi-sources generation system are generally conflicting with each other. This paper presents a multiobjective formulation to allow optimizing simultaneously both the annualized renewable energy cost the system reliability defined as the renewable energy - load disparity ({RELD}). This later takes into account the lack of energy as well as the exceed weighted by a penalty factor. The optimization is reach by acting on the penetration rate of each type of renewable generation technologies in order to satisfy a certain load curve.

These energy management decisions are typically envisaged to be made via market-based frameworks, aspiring the so-called Local Electricity Markets ({LEMs}). A rich literature of studies models such {LEMs} adopting various modeling assumptions and proposes various Market Mechanisms towards making dispatch and pricing decisions. In this paper, we make a systematic presentation of a {LEM} formulation, elaborating on the cornerstone attributes of the market model, i.e. the Market Scope, the Modeling Assumptions, the Market Objective, and the Market Mechanism. We discuss the different market model choices and their implications and then focus on the prevailing approaches of Market Mechanisms. Finally, we classify the relevant literature based on the market model that it adopts and the proposed Market Mechanism, visualize the results and also discuss patterns and trends.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the behavior of a day-ahead ({DA}) retail electrical energy market with price-based demand response from air conditioning ({AC}) loads through a hierarchical multiagent framework, employing a machine learning approach. At the top level of the hierarchy, a retailer agent buys energy from the {DA} wholesale market and sells it to the consumers. The goal of the retailer agent is to maximize its profit by setting the optimal retail prices, considering the response of the price-sensitive loads. Upon receiving the retail prices, at the lower level of the hierarchy, the {AC} agents employ a Q-learning algorithm to optimize their consumption patterns through modifying the temperature set-points of the devices, considering both consumption costs and users' comfort preferences. Since the retailer agent does not have direct access to the {AC} loads' underlying dynamics and decision process (i.e., incomplete information) the data privacy of the consumers becomes a source of uncertainty in the retailer's decision model. The retailer relies on techniques from the field of machine learning to develop a reliable model of the aggregate behavior of the price-sensitive loads to reduce the uncertainty of the decision-making process. Hence, a multiagent framework based on machine learning enables us to address issues such as interoperability and decision-making under incomplete information in a system that maintains the data privacy of the consumers. We will show that using the proposed model, all the agents are able to optimize their behavior simultaneously. Simulation results show that the proposed approach leads to a reduction in overall power consumption cost as the system converges to its equilibrium. This also coincides with maximization in the retailer's profit. We will also show that the same decision architecture can be used to reduce peak load to defer/avoid distribution system upgrades under high penetration of photo-voltaic power in the distribution feeder.},

In order to overcome these obstacles, the diversification of renewable energy technologies, programmable or not, coupled with different types of storage, daily and seasonal, is recommended. The optimization of the different energy sources is a multi-objective optimization problem because it concerns economical, technical and environmental aspects. The aim of this study is to present the model {EPLANopt}, developed by Eurac Research, which couples the deterministic simulation model {EnergyPLAN} developed by Aalborg University with a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm built on the Python library {DEAP}. The test case is the energy system of South Tyrol, for which results obtained through this methodology are presented. Particular attention is devoted to the analysis of energy efficiency in buildings. A curve representing the marginal costs of the different energy efficiency strategies versus the annual energy saving is applied to the model through an external Python script. This curve describes the energy efficiency costs for different types of buildings depending on construction period and location.},

In the field of bottom-up short-term energy system models, high resolution in time and space, the implementation of sector coupling and the adoption of a multi-objective investment optimization have never been achieved simultaneously because of the high computational effort. Within this paper, such a bottom-up shortterm model which simultaneously implements (i) hourly temporal resolution, (ii) multi-node approach thus high spatial resolution, (iii) integrates the electric, thermal and transport sectors and (iv) implements a multi-objective investment optimization method is proposed. The developed method is applied to the Italian energy system at 2050 to test and show its main features. The model allows the evaluation of the hourly curtailments for each node. The optimization highlights that the cheapest solutions work towards high curtailments and low investments in flexibility options. In order to further reduce the {CO}2 emissions the investments in flexibility options like electric storage batteries and reinforcement and enlargement of the transmission grid become relevant.},

Thus, this work compares the socio-economic impacts of various strategies to decarbonize the energy system by 2050 within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals ({SDGs}). We demonstrate that transitions that protect domestic strategic assets and preserve key industrial sectors correspondingly deliver a socially equitable transition. Adopting a technology-agnostic approach to decarbonizing the European electricity system maximizes the associated co-benefits and potentially increases the gross value added ({GVA}) to the economy by 50\% relative to a business as usual scenario. This new way of thinking about the economic transition fundamentally reframes the discussion from one of cost to one of opportunity.},

	abstract = {A fundamental societal concern in energy system transitions is the distribution of benefits and costs across populations. A recent transition, the {US} shale gas boom, has dramatically altered the domestic energy outlook and global markets; however, the social equity implications have not been meaningfully assessed and accounted for in public and private decision making. In this study, we develop and demonstrate a systematic approach to quantify the multi-dimensional equity state of an energy system, with a focus on the shale gas boom in the Appalachian basin. We tailor variants of standard equity metrics as well as develop new empirical and analytical methods and metrics to assess spatial, temporal, income, and racial equity as it relates to air quality, climate change, and labor market impacts across the natural gas supply chain. We find moderate to high spatial inequities with respect to the distribution of production (Gini coefficient (η) = 0.93), consumption for electric power generation (η = 0.68), commercial, industrial, and residential end use (η = 0.72), job creation (η = 0.72), and air pollution-related deaths (η = 0.77), which are largely driven by geographically-fixed natural gas abundance and demand. Air quality impacts are also regressive, such that mortality risk induced by natural gas activity generally increases as income decreases; for example, mortality risk (m) (in units of premature mortality per 100 000 people) for the lowest income class ({\textless}\$15 000; m = 0.22 in 2016) is higher (18\%–31\%) than for the highest income class ({\textgreater}\$150 000; m = 0.27 in 2016). These risks are higher for white (m = 0.30 in 2016) than non-white (m = 0.16 in 2016) populations, which is largely a result of the demographics of rural communities within the vicinity of natural gas development. With respect to local labor market impacts within producing counties, we find marginal declines in income inequality (2.8\% ± 1.0\%) and poverty rates (9.9\% ± 1.7\%) during the boom, although household income increases for the wealthiest and decreases for the poorest. At a systems-level, there is an implied air quality-employment tradeoff of 3 ({\textless}1 to 7) job-years created per life-year lost; this tradeoff varies spatially (−1100 to 4400 life-years lost minus job-years created), wherein the job benefit outweighs the air quality costs in most producing counties whereas in all other counties the reverse is true. We also observe temporal inequities, with air quality and employment impacts following the boom-and-bust cycle, while climate impacts are largely borne by future generations. Cross-impact elasticities (ε), which measure the sensitivity between different types of impacts, reveal that employment increases are sensitive to and coupled with increases in air and climate impacts (ε = 1.1 and ε = 1.3, respectively). The metrics applied here facilitate the evaluation and design of countervailing policies and systems that explicitly account for social inequities mediated through energy infrastructure, supply, and demand. For example, in future energy system transition, such equity metrics can be used to facilitate decisions related to the siting of low-carbon infrastructure such as transmission lines and wind turbines and the phase-out of fossil fuel infrastructure, as well as to demonstrate changes in distributional tradeoffs such as the decoupling of environmental and employment effects.},

Key Points:
Members from various organizations aligned with local transit riders to create the Transportation Coalition and advocate for extended night and weekend services for the Winston-Salem public transportation system.

Conclusions:
Partnerships between community-based organizations are crucial to identifying and addressing the needs of a community. The Transportation Coalition will continue its work in local public transportation policy. A long-term policy objective is fare-free transit on the city bus system.},

Nothing like the conscious system-wide change required has been attempted before. Rapid policy decisions risk embedding existing injustices or creating new ones unless steps are taken to ameliorate those risks. We present a model that takes a whole-system view of the {UK} spatial economy, examining how increasing distance costs (e.g. through fuel tax hikes) have unequal impacts on regions and sectors. The model establishes an important carbon transition policy principle: change in spatial flows of internal trade, which are certain to occur rapidly during transition, have measurable energy justice implications. Peripheral economic regions, in rural and coastal areas and many city outskirts are most vulnerable, as are petrochemical, agricultural and connected sectors. Policy must go beyond identifying places and sectors most affected: it is the connections between them that matter most. The "push" of spatially aware fiscal policy needs to be combined with the "pull" of targeted interventions designed to promote low-carbon intermediate connections. This is not only just, but would help make (potentially costly) transition more politically acceptable.},

By applying an explicitly spatial lens to conceptualize energy poverty as a form of injustice, it contributes to debates in the domain of ‘energy justice’, where previous examinations of energy deprivation through a justice framing have focused on inequalities between social groups and often marginalized questions of spatial difference. We start from the premise that geographic disparities in the risk and incidence of domestic energy deprivation are a key component of energy justice. An extensive literature review has allowed us to highlight the spatial and temporal variation of cross-sectoral and entire-energy-chain injustices that lead to elevated energy poverty risks. These processes contribute to the rise of energy injustices via four mechanisms – which we term landscapes of material deprivation, geographic underpinnings of energy affordability, vicious cycles of vulnerability, and spaces of misrecognition – operating at a multiplicity of scales. While lending some support to area-based approaches towards energy poverty alleviation, our findings also suggest that such policies alone may marginalize the underlying structural dynamics that (re)produce spatial inequalities. Therefore, achieving energy justice necessitates broader interventions in the fundamental driving forces of spatial inequality.},

	abstract = {Sustainable energy transitions necessarily comprise both socio-technical aspects as well as important implications for social justice. However, in existing scholarship, these are mainly treated as distinct phenomena. The purpose of this paper is to outline a comprehensive approach that pulls together critical aspects of both socio-technical development and energy justice in understanding sustainable transitions. Drawing on the strengths of both sets of literature, we argue that a comprehensive approach requires analyses to account for the co-evolution of institutional change, material change and relational change, with a cross-cutting concern for multiple spatialities and normative implications. We then illustrate this approach through three brief case studies of multi-scalar solar uptake in Portugal, bringing out how justice considerations are intricately involved in the practices and politics of these concrete, broadly representative instances of sustainable energy transitions.},

	abstract = {Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy ({RE}) is one of the core strategies in developing sustainable future energy systems. But in planning such a transition, it is common to consider primarily cost and greenhouse gas reduction, as typified by cost-mitigation curves that have become widespread. Such assessments tend to leave important considerations of energy justice on the periphery. This paper puts forward an alternative assessment technique, incorporating various indicators of social equity in order to assess the priority of power plant replacement that would lead to the greatest improvement in benefits, while placing the burden of system changes away from the most vulnerable. An example of the application of this approach is presented for prioritization of the retirement and replacement (with {RE}) of Australia s ageing fleet of coal-fired power plants. The assessment shows very different results from a standard cost-mitigation approach, with the retirement of the large brown coal power plants (including the recently retired Hazelwood power plant) and the replacement with wind power (where applicable) promoting the best overall outcomes on both cost and equity. Considering a selection of high priority indicators with many locally-specific data sets, the approach adds significant contextual relevance to prioritization, and is considered to offer useful findings for policy-makers.},

Amidst these challenges, energy justice has emerged to conceptualize a world where all individuals, across all areas, have safe, affordable and sustainable energy that is, essentially, socially just. Simultaneously, new social and technological solutions to energy problems continually evolve, and interest in the concept of sociotechnical transitions has grown. However, an element often missing from such transitions frameworks is explicit engagement with energy justice frameworks. Despite the development of an embryonic set of literature around these themes, an obvious research gap has emerged: can energy justice and transitions frameworks be combined? This paper argues that they can. It does so through an exploration of the multi-level perspective on sociotechnical systems and an integration of energy justice at the model's niche, regime and landscape level. It presents the argument that it is within the overarching process of sociotechnical change that issues of energy justice emerge. Here, inattention to social justice issues can cause injustices, whereas attention to them can provide a means to examine and potential resolve them.},

However, the impact of capacity expansion of renewables on the sustainability dimensions has not been rigor­ ously assessed for the Indian scenario. In this perspective, the present research investigates the optimal capacity installation of renewables using a proposed modelling framework. The framework encompasses a multi-objective optimization model interlinked to a sustainability model. This work develops a simplified temporally resolved electricity model of India to explore nine broad scenarios. The Pareto front solutions are ranked under a set of decision-maker preference scenarios across six sustainability metrics, including economic dispatchability, emission, water-use, land-use, safety, and employment. Results indicate a possibility of 25.5\%–41.2\% of renewable penetration by 2030. The Pareto frontiers with a higher share of onshore wind, utility solar photo­ voltaic, and dammed hydro are among the top-ranked solutions. High river hydro supported by high levels of offshore wind can significantly contribute to low carbon generation without overshooting the upfront cost. Overall, the electricity mix with the least coal power generation of 1175 {TWh}/yr estimates to be the most sustainable solution. This paper addresses the sensitivity to changes in input lifetime year and cost assumptions; output shows considerable robustness of annual system costs to the lifetime of technologies and higher sensitivity to utility solar and onshore wind costs.},

	abstract = {Recent academic evidence suggests that, in contrast to what is often thought, the introduction of renewable energy infrastructures often leads to negative, not positive, social equity outcomes. Against this background, this paper aims to develop and empirically illustrate an integrative framework for analysing the work – or ‘agency’ – exercised by actors operating within and across different global contexts to align renewable energy and social equity. To this end, the paper first reviews three generative conceptions of agency in the energy transitions literature: institutional work, imaginaries and energy justice. In reviewing their explanatory power as well as their shortcomings, the paper concludes that these different conceptions of agency can be integrated meaningfully in an expanded conceptualisation of institutional work that spans three distinct domains: i) ‘reimagining’, ii) ‘recoding’ and iii) ‘reconfiguring’. This article demonstrates that the three domains can be understood to reiteratively feed into each other in what we call the ‘triple re-cycle’. These iterations produce either bolstering effects that strengthen the potential for positive social equity outcomes or evaporative effects that diminish or undermine this potential. We empirically illustrate the framework in case studies from Germany and South Africa. Overall, we argue that the triple re-cycle, as a heuristic, can provide new insights by conceptually connecting multiple domains of agency in energy transitions, including discursive and material aspects, across different global contexts. Our hope is that identifying potential agency in this way supports work to improve the social equity outcomes of energy transitions globally.},

Equity is highlighted in the Biden-Harris January 2021 Executive Order No. 13,985, “Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities” (Exec. Order (2021)). When applied to the energy \& utilities sector, ”energy equity” refers to the condition in which energy is provided to all in a consistent and systematically fair, just, and impartial manner regardless of race, geography, social standing, or economic position. Following this definition, energy equity is fundamental to healthy and prosperous social and economic systems, and contributes to regional and national security and stability. Data show that underserved populations generally suffer disproportionately from power outages, high energy prices, and polluting energy generation facilities. Numerous policy measures that include energy storage (i.e., residential, commercial, and utility scale batteries, and other technologies) can help provide energy equity to all populations. These policy measures address procurement mandates, replacement of peaker units, financial incentives, ownership policies and community projects, integrated resource planning and pilot programs, resilience, and long duration energy storage.},

We first determine the outdoor temperature at which households start using cooling systems, the inflection temperature. Our relative energy poverty metric, the energy equity gap, is defined as the difference in the inflection temperatures between low and high-income groups. In our study region, we estimate the energy equity gap to be between 4.7–7.5 °F (2.6–4.2 °C). Within a sample of 4577 households, we found 86 energy-poor and 214 energy-insecure households. In contrast, the income-based energy poverty metric, energy burden (10\% threshold), identified 141 households as energy-insecure. Only three households overlap between our energy equity gap and the income-based measure. Thus, the energy equity gap reveals a hidden but complementary aspect of energy poverty and insecurity.},

The study identified 261 plans and initiatives in the 50 cities during the 2010–2020 period that had connections between social equity and sustainability. Results indicate that cities still have many opportunities to improve plans and initiatives when undertaking revisions. To that end, 21 types of goals and initiatives are identified from the data set to show a composite picture of how cities can integrate social equity with sustainability in this area. Of the 21 types, only 7 appeared in more than 50\% of the cities. The study also provides an analysis of opportunities for robust engagement, implementation, equity tracking, and connections of goals across sectors. An additional analysis shows that cities with greater attention to the sustainability-equity nexus tend to lean toward the center-left Democratic Party, to have higher education and income, and to have sustainability offices.},

	abstract = {The Paris Agreement does not only stipulate to limit the global average temperature increase to well below 2 °C, it also calls for ‘making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions’. Consequently, there is an urgent need to understand the implications of climate targets for energy systems and quantify the associated investment requirements in the coming decade. A meaningful analysis must however consider the near-term mitigation requirements to avoid the overshoot of a temperature goal. It must also include the recently observed fast technological progress in key mitigation options. Here, we use a new and unique scenario ensemble that limit peak warming by construction and that stems from seven up-to-date integrated assessment models. This allows us to study the near-term implications of different limits to peak temperature increase under a consistent and up-to-date set of assumptions. We find that ambitious immediate action allows for limiting median warming outcomes to well below 2 °C in all models. By contrast, current nationally determined contributions for 2030 would add around 0.2 °C of peak warming, leading to an unavoidable transgression of 1.5 °C in all models, and 2 °C in some. In contrast to the incremental changes as foreseen by current plans, ambitious peak warming targets require decisive emission cuts until 2030, with the most substantial contribution to decarbonization coming from the power sector. Therefore, investments into low-carbon power generation need to increase beyond current levels to meet the Paris goals, especially for solar and wind technologies and related system enhancements for electricity transmission, distribution and storage. Estimates on absolute investment levels, up-scaling of other low-carbon power generation technologies and investment shares in less ambitious scenarios vary considerably across models. In scenarios limiting peak warming to below 2 °C, while coal is phased out quickly, oil and gas are still being used significantly until 2030, albeit at lower than current levels. This requires continued investments into existing oil and gas infrastructure, but investments into new fields in such scenarios might not be needed. The results show that credible and effective policy action is essential for ensuring efficient allocation of investments aligned with medium-term climate targets.},

These small power systems typically host a hybrid energy system of diverse architecture and size. An effective integration of renewable energies resources requires careful design. Sizing methodologies often lack the consideration for reliability and this aspect is limited to power adequacy. There exists an inherent trade-off between renewable integration, cost, and reliability. To bridge this gap, a sizing methodology has been developed to perform multi-objective optimization, considering the three design objectives mentioned above. This method is based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm ({NSGA}-{II}) that returns the set of optimal solutions under all objectives. This method aims to identify the trade-offs between renewable integration, reliability, and cost allowing to choose the adequate architecture and sizing accordingly. As a case study, we consider an autonomous microgrid, currently being installed in a rural area in Mali. The results show that increasing system reliability can be done at the least cost if carried out in the initial design stage.},

Since optimization is an inherent part of these research fields, more optimization related frameworks have arisen in the past few years.

To address this issue, we have developed pymoo, a multi-objective optimization framework in Python. We provide a guide to getting started with our framework by demonstrating the implementation of an exemplary constrained multi-objective optimization scenario. Moreover, we give a high-level overview of the architecture of pymoo to show its capabilities followed by an explanation of each module and its corresponding sub-modules. The implementations in our framework are customizable and algorithms can be modified/extended by supplying custom operators. Moreover, a variety of single, multi- and many-objective test problems are provided and gradients can be retrieved by automatic differentiation out of the box. Also, pymoo addresses practical needs, such as the parallelization of function evaluations, methods to visualize low and high-dimensional spaces, and tools for multi-criteria decision making.

	abstract = {Energy justice is now an established research topic in the field of energy policy. Despite the growing popularity of energy justice research, however, conceptual and analytical frameworks used in the field have remained limited. This paper reviews the prevailing three-tenet framework of energy justice which has shaped the current discourse based on the three dimensions—distributional, procedural, and recognition justice. As an effort to contribute to expanding the research agenda of energy justice problems, we propose a new understanding of the production of energy injustice by characterizing three institutionalized tendencies of dominant modern energy systems: (1) preference for large-scale technical systems and distancing of system designs from local decision-making processes, (2) centralization of energy production and concomitant distancing of supply from users, and (3) widespread ‘risk-taking’ tendencies portrayed by designers and proponents of current energy supply systems as a necessary ‘price to pay’ for technological innovation and social progress. We then connect these three tendencies to political, economic, and technical ideologies of modernism that often provide justifications for energy inequity: (1) top-down political and economic decision-making systems, (2) technical interpretation of sustainability, (3) specialist understanding of fairness, and (4) path dependency in the modern energy paradigm. Finally, we present an illustration of how this new conception of systemic energy injustice can be applied in practice using the case of South Korea's nuclear power system and Seoul's One Less Nuclear Power Plant Initiative.},

The development of energy supply networks is strongly correlated with the economics of energy sources as well as ecological and socio-political issues. However, the energy supply network is often distant from the social perspective. This paper therefore combines examination of perceptions and awareness of general public (web-based questionnaire) and top energy experts (a Delphi survey) on the energy supply network and identifies their potential integration in energy supply decision making processes. The results showed that public should be better informed as well as integrated into designing energy supply network as the prosumers gain power and the energy suppliers will no longer dominate the market. Public actors are ready to shape sustainable energy supply and also willing to pay 5.8\% more for a sustainable energy supply. The majority are prepared to invest in renewable energy supply network close to their place of residence. Another result is that the public is calling for a shift in priority towards more sustainable and socially friendlier energy supply rather than focusing mainly on the economic and technical perspectives.},

To provide guidance for a regional market design in China, this study develops an optimization model to simulate the power system operation results of an integrated regional market, and compares the actual operating costs with the optimized costs to obtain economic benefits from market integration. Three allocation mechanisms are designed to allocate the benefits. The market integration of China Southern Grid region in 2017 is employed as a case study and the major conclusions achieved are that: (1) The total economic gains from electricity market integration are {US}\$ 5.34 billion, representing 16\% of the actual operational cost in the China Southern Grid region. (2) Hydropower generation has the greatest impact on the integration benefits, while the capacity of cross-border transmission lines has the least impact. (3) The results of benefits allocation under the mechanisms of Equal share, Shapley value and Raiffa value vary substantially, and a good balance of the equity and feasibility is needed in designing the benefits allocation mechanisms. These obtained results confirm the fact that market integration will contribute to larger benefits with a fair allocation mechanism, thus deserving to be implemented during the current round of electricity market reform in China.},

	abstract = {The overall evaluation of small autonomous hybrid power systems ({SAHPS}) that contain renewable and conventional power sources depends on economic and environmental criteria, which are often conﬂicting objectives. The solution of this problem belongs to the ﬁeld of non-linear combinatorial multiobjective optimisation. In a multiobjective optimisation problem, the target is not to ﬁnd an optimal solution, but a set of non-dominated solutions called Pareto-set. The present article considers as an economic objective the minimisation of system’s cost of energy ({COE}), whereas the environmental objective is the minimisation of the total greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions of the system during its lifetime. The main novelty of this article is that the calculation of {GHG} emissions is based on life cycle analysis ({LCA}) of each system’s component. In {LCA}, the whole life cycle emissions of a component are taken into account, from raw materials extraction to ﬁnal disposal/recycling. This article adopts the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm ({NSGA}-{II}), which in combination with a proposed local search procedure effectively solves the multiobjective optimisation problem of {SAHPS}. Two main categories of {SAHPS} are examined with different energy storage: lead-acid batteries and hydrogen storage. The results indicate the superiority of batteries under both economic and environmental criteria.},

	abstract = {The optimal design of off-grid microgrids in developing countries is difficult to achieve, as several political and socio-economic risks can hamper investments of private companies. Estimating the energy demand and its growth is a challenging task, subject to high uncertainty that rarely have been accounted for in multi-year simulations at hourly resolution. Besides, from a long-term perspective, the assets degradation can signifi­ cantly affect the performance of stand-alone hybrid energy systems. In this paper, we address these challenges and propose a novel stochastic dynamic method to size microgrids, simulating with accuracy the system oper­ ation and considering the unavoidable uncertainty in load growth and the components ageing. A predefined scenario tree structure allows capturing the load growth uncertainty and obtaining different capacity expansion strategies for each scenario. An illustrative case study for an isolated power system in Kenya using data collected in 23 Kenyan microgrids is shown. The proposed stochastic formulation results in a considerable reduction of the size of components with respect to traditional single-year approaches. Savings in terms of Net Present Cost ({NPC}) are beyond 16-20\% and the effects of assets degradation are about 6\%. Results lead to recommend multi-year optimization tools, as single-year methodologies can hardly achieve the same performances.},

Yet more pessimistically, this rapid growth could also represent a trend in uncritical commitment without appropriate reflectivity and without maximizing societal impact. Carefully considering these different interpretations, this perspective article reflects on four core challenges and opportunities for energy justice scholarship and practice in its next wave of development: (1) the alignment, connectivity and orientation of energy justice terminology, (2) leveraging impact and achieving outcomes in partnership between academic and non-academic communities and activists, (3) the need to acknowledge and define the audience for energy justice contributions and (4) the need for energy justice scholars and practitioners to “practice what we preach”.

The aim is firstly to review the current state of the art in the energy justice literature and, secondly, to present findings that support novel recommendations with the potential to enhance the impact of energy justice research, including applications in the economic and planning policy sectors. Critically, our study demonstrates that the literature lacks diversity in its author basis and research design. By contrast, conceptual frameworks and the geographies and technologies of global energy injustice are proliferating. These results illustrate that energy justice has power and agency as a tool. It can act as a protagonist in energy research, provoking researchers to remain reflexively normative and active in identifying injustices and vulnerabilities, and it can act as a promising progenitor, creating new research methods and themes.},

	abstract = {Models for supporting climate adaptation and mitigation planning, mostly in the form of Integrated Assessment Models, are poorly equipped for aiding questions related to fairness of adaptation and mitigation strategies, because they often disregard distributional outcomes. When evaluating policies using such models, the costs and benefits are typically aggregated across all actors in the system, and over the entire planning horizon. While a policy may be beneficial when considering the aggregate outcome, it can be harmful to some people, somewhere, at some point in time. The practice of aggregating over all actors and over time thus gives rise to problems of justice; it could also exacerbate existing injustices. While the literature discusses some of these injustices in ad-hoc and case specific manner, a systematic approach for considering distributive justice in model-based climate change planning is lacking. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing 11 requirements that an Integrated Assessment Model should meet in order to enable the assessment of distributive justice in climate mitigation and adaptation policies. We derive the requirements from various ethical imperatives stemming from the theory of distributive justice. More specifically, we consider both intra-generational (among people within one generation) and intergenerational (between generations) distributive justice. We investigate to what extent the 11 requirements are being met in recent model-based climate planning studies, and highlight several directions for future research to advance the accounting for distributive justice in model-based support for climate change planning.

	abstract = {Low-carbon transitions are often assumed as positive phenomena, because they supposedly reduce carbon emissions, yet without vigilance, there is evidence that they can in fact create new injustices and vulnerabilities, while also failing to address pre-existing structural drivers of injustice in energy markets and the wider socio-economy. With this in mind, we examine four European low-carbon transitions from an unusual normative perspective: that of energy justice. Because a multitude of studies looks at the co-benefits of renewable energy, low-carbon mobility, or climate change mitigation, we instead ask in this paper what are the types of injustices associated with low-carbon transitions? Relatedly, in what ways do low-carbon transitions worsen social risks or vulnerabilities? Lastly, what policies might be deployed to make these transitions more just? We answer these questions by first elaborating an “energy justice” framework consisting of four distinct dimensions—distributive justice (costs and benefits), procedural justice (due process), cosmopolitan justice (global externalities), and recognition justice (vulnerable groups). We then examine four European low-carbon transitions—nuclear power in France, smart meters in Great Britain, electric vehicles in Norway, and solar energy in Germany—through this critical justice lens. In doing so, we draw from original data collected from 64 semi-structured interviews with expert participants as well as five public focus groups and the monitoring of twelve large internet forums. We document 120 distinct energy injustices across these four transitions, including 19 commonly recurring injustices. We aim to show how when low-carbon transitions unfold, deeper injustices related to equity, distribution, and fairness invariably arise.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, evolutionary algorithms ({EAs}) have been systematically developed to solve mono-, multi-, and many-objective optimization problems, in this order. Despite some efforts in unifying different types of mono-objective evolutionary and non-{EAs}, researchers are not interested enough in unifying all three types of optimization problems together. Such a unified algorithm will allow users to work with a single software enabling one-time implementation of solution representation, operators, objectives, and constraints formulations across several objective dimensions. For the first time, we propose a unified evolutionary optimization algorithm for solving all three classes of problems specified above, based on the recently proposed elitist, guided nondominated sorting procedure, developed for solving many-objectives problems. Using a new niching-based selection procedure, our proposed unified algorithm automatically degenerates to an efficient equivalent population-based algorithm for each class. No extra parameters are needed. Extensive simulations are performed on unconstrained and constrained test problems having single-, two-, multi-, and many-objectives and on two engineering optimization design problems.

	abstract = {In future urban energy systems, smart grid systems will be crucial for the integration of renewable energy. However, their deployment has moral implications, for example regarding data privacy, user autonomy, or distribution of responsibilities. ‘Energy justice’ is one of the most comprehensive frameworks to address these implications, but remains limited regarding smart grids, and regarding concrete guidelines for designers and policymakers. In this paper, we fill this gap by answering the following research question: How do design choices in smart grid projects impact energy justice? Thereby, four smart grid pilot projects are evaluated in a comparative qualitative case study research design. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and a content analysis. Our findings contribute to the energy justice literature with insights regarding the design for distributive, recognition, and procedural justice. They underscore the importance of fairness in data governance, participatory design, user control and autonomy, technology inclusiveness, and the design for expansion and replication. Future research should explore the feasibility to govern smart grids as commons and the relationship between trust and perceptions of justice. We conclude with policy recommendations for funding future smart grid experiments and for facilitating the implementation of storage through electricity sector regulation.},

It is argued, in particular, that the project increases the precariousness of vulnerable communities, who are exposed to the loss of livelihoods due to the enclosure of common land and extra-legal mechanisms through which land acquisitions for the project have reportedly taken place. This case exemplifies how solar mega-projects may manifest a regime of accumulation whereby low-carbon coalitions of interests can maximize their gains by dispossessing vulnerable social groups of their life-sustaining assets.},

One of the most pressing issues is the appropriate allocation of renewable power plants, as the question of where to produce renewable electricity is highly controversial. Here we explore this issue through analysis of the efficient and equitable spatial allocation of wind turbines and photovoltaic power plants in Germany. We combine multiple methods, including legal analysis, economic and energy modelling, monetary valuation and numerical optimization. We find that minimum distances between renewable power plants and human settlements should be as small as is legally possible. Even small reductions in efficiency lead to large increases in equity. By considering electricity grid expansion costs, we find a more even allocation of power plants across the country than is the case when grid expansion costs are neglected.},

In this study, we quantify the trade-oﬀs between cost-eﬃcient (least-cost) and regionally equitable {DREG} allocation in terms of electricity generation costs, investment needs, and {DREG} capacity requirements. Using the case of the ambitious and publicly-approved Swiss Energy Strategy 2050, we set up a bottom-up, technology-rich electricity system model {EXPANSE} with Modeling to Generate Alternatives at a spatial resolution of 2’258 Swiss municipalities. In order to measure regional equity implication, we adapt the concepts of the Lorenz curve and the Gini coeﬃcient. We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant trade-oﬀ by 2035 in Switzerland: 50\% increase in regional equity when allocating {DREG} to various Swiss regions on the basis of population or electricity demand leads to 18\% higher electricity generation costs. Least-cost allocation implies concentrating {DREG} and associated investments to few most productive locations only. Solar {PV} is the key technology for increasing regional equity. We conclude that in countries with spatially-uneven {DREG} resources like Switzerland, any policies that focus on cost eﬃciency should anticipate regional equity implications in advance and, if desired, minimize them by promoting solar {PV}.},

In response, state and local governments have developed solar equity programs, primarily focused on increasing adoption by low- and moderate-income ({LMI}) households. This study merged national datasets that estimate rooftop solar potential, the distribution of rooftop solar systems, and census tract- level socioeconomic and demographic characteristics to answer three questions. First, how are spatial distributions of rooftop potential and penetration similar and different across cities? Second, how is rooftop penetration distributed across non-{LMI} and {LMI} communities in different cities? Third, how do the relationships between rooftop penetration and local socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, identified as barriers to solar adoption, differ? Using {GIS}, bivariate and multivariate analyses, these questions were examined in four {US} cities – Riverside and San Bernardino, California, Washington, {DC}, and Chicago, Illinois – to understand both universal and distinct local manifestations. Findings include: higher rooftop potential existed in some {LMI} communities; higher rooftop potential did not necessarily translate to higher rooftop penetration, especially if higher potential was in {LMI} communities; and beyond income, other socioeconomic and demographic characteristics such as race/ethnicity, limited English proficiency, age of housing stock, and internet access were associated with rooftop penetration. While there remains great potential for expanding rooftop solar to {LMI} households and communities, understanding the local dynamics of solar potential and penetration may inform better policy development and implementation.},

	abstract = {How can leaders successfully craft energy or climate policy to support an initiative that citizens oppose? This paper considers this challenge from a change management perspective applied to public governance. It ﬁrst draws on change management theory to develop a framework for altering mass public perspectives. The framework consists of four phases: i) problematizing the issue, ii) laying a foundation for change, iii) reshaping perspectives, and iv) entrenching support. Drawing from the insights gleaned from the establishment of Japan's nuclear power program, the paper further argues that in order to succeed in mass perceptual change, policymakers must ﬁrst clearly understand the contextual environment in which the policy is being formulated. In doing so, policymakers will be better able to customize policy design to appeal to stakeholder perceptions and sentiments. Although the context of this paper is the perceptual modiﬁcation of public opinion to support nuclear power, the authors suggest that the same framework can be applied to perceptual modiﬁcation of any policy that the general public might be opposed to. In the energy sector, this could apply to fostering a transition to renewable energy as easily as it applies to nurturing nuclear power development. However, the Japanese case puts forth a caveat in this regard, there is evidence that the mindsets of the Japanese policymakers were predisposed to advocacy of nuclear power and once policymakers commit to a technological trajectory, it is hard to engender a change of course. Therefore, the article concludes by speculating on how the perceptions of policymakers might be similarly altered through eﬀorts from the alternative energy sector to foster policy change.},

Using data for recentlyinstalled systems, we estimate the balance of beneﬁts and costs associated with installing a nonutility solar {PV} system today. We also study the geographical distribution of the various subsidies that are made available to owners of rooftop solar {PV} systems, and compare it to distributions of population and income. We ﬁnd that, after accounting for federal subsidies and local rebates and assuming a discount rate of 7\%, the private beneﬁts of new installations will exceed private costs only in seven of the 19 states for which we have data and only if customers can sell excess power to the electric grid at the retail price. These states are characterized by abundant sunshine (California, Texas and Nevada) or by high electricity prices (New York). Public beneﬁts from reduced air pollution and climate change impact exceed the costs of the various subsidies offered system owners for less than 10\% of the systems installed, even assuming a 2\% discount rate. Subsidies ﬂowed disproportionately to counties with higher median incomes in 2006. In 2014, the distribution of subsidies was closer to that of population income, but subsidies still ﬂowed disproportionately to the better-off. The total, upfront, subsidy per kilowatt of installed capacity has fallen from \$5200 in 2006 to \$1400 in 2014, but the absolute magnitude of subsidy has soared as installed capacity has grown explosively. We see considerable differences in the balance of costs and beneﬁts even within states, indicating that local factors such as system price and solar resource are important, and that policies (e.g. net metering) could be made more efﬁcient by taking local conditions into account.},

	abstract = {A reliable and cost-effective electricity system transition requires both the identification of optimal target states and the definition of political and regulatory frameworks that enable these target states to be achieved. Fundamental optimization models are frequently used for the determination of cost-optimal system configurations. They represent a normative approach and typically assume markets with perfect competition. However, it is well known that real systems do not behave in such an optimal way, as decision-makers do not have perfect information at their disposal and real market actors do not take decisions in a purely rational way. These deficiencies lead to increased costs or missed targets, often referred to as an “efficiency gap”. For making rational political decisions, it might be valuable to know which factors influence this efficiency gap and to what extent. In this paper, we identify and quantify this gap by soft-linking a fundamental electricity market model and an agent-based simulation model, which allows the consideration of these effects. In order to distinguish between model-inherent differences and non-ideal market behavior, a rigorous harmonization of the models was conducted first. The results of the comparative analysis show that the efficiency gap increases with higher renewable energy shares and that information deficits and policy instruments affect operational decisions of power market participants and resulting overall costs significantly.},

We use the System Advisor Model to model the nuclear reactor thermal power input and power cycle operating modes. We combine this robust engineering model with a mixed-integer linear program model for optimized dispatch scheduling. We then simulate the coupled nuclear and thermal storage system under different market scenarios with varying price volatility. We find that the coupled plant outperforms the base plant under markets where energy price peaks fluctuate by a factor of two or more about the mean price. We show that a calculated power purchase agreement price for the plant improves by up to 10\% when operating under California energy market conditions. Sensitivity analysis on the thermal storage cost shows that the optimal design remains unchanged even when doubling costs.},

	abstract = {Islands’ energy systems present a challenge in energy planning due to a limited amount of resources which could be used to make islands self-sufficient and sustainable. This paper presents a novel approach for defining energy system of a carbon neutral island which utilizes only intermittent renewable energy sources in combination with vehicle-to-grid concept as a demand response technology, where marine transportation has also been taken into account. Integration of power, heating, cooling and transport sectors has been modelled by using {EnergyPLAN} tool, i.e. its updated November 2017 version which is capable of simulating vehicle-to-grid operation in mentioned conditions. Power supply capacities have been selected not by using scenario analysis but by implementing an optimization procedure based on series of simulations in {EnergyPLAN} tool. In order to choose the most suitable power supply system configuration, two boundary conditions have been defined. Firstly, only solar and wind capacities must be utilized. Secondly, total electricity import and export must be balanced, i.e. the island has to be {CO}2 neutral. In order to validate the approach, Croatian Island of Korčula has been used as the case study. 2011 has been selected as the base year for which final energy consumption has been calculated. The final simulation year was set to 2030 in which optimal capacities are installed. It has been shown that configuration with 40 {MW} of wind and 6 {MW} of installed solar capacities presents the least cost solution, while 22 {MW} of wind in combination with 30 {MW} of installed solar capacities provides the lowest amount of total electricity import and export. Analysis of the vehicle-to-grid share reduction has shown increase in total import and export in both cases, while transmission peak loads have not been influenced.},

The new 2030 framework calls for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40\% compared to the 1990 level, yet the Republic of Croatia does not have such an ambitious plan. In times when wind plants and photovoltaic systems have reached grid parity in the majority of European countries, this paper analysed the inﬂuence of construction of wind and photovoltaic power plants in order to present the optimal constructing ratio of such systems on the Croatian power system load. Simulations have been conducted in the {EnergyPLAN} model for the year 2012. After the simulation presented promising scenarios, applying the Pareto analysis showed the optimal scenario for generating electricity from renewables, scenario with the lowest import of electricity, scenario with the lowest {CO}2 emissions and with the lowest critical excess electricity production. In addition, all of the scenarios were subjected to a multiple criteria decision analysis in order to ﬁnd the best overall scenario. After showing that the best overall scenario was 1.65 {GW} of wind power plants and 1.6 {GW} of installed {PV} capacity, a multi-criteria analysis was performed in order to observe the behaviour of grading the scenarios. Indeed, all of the simulations proved that {PV} will have a bigger role in the Republic of Croatia than expected.},

	abstract = {Finland is to increase the share of {RES} (renewable energy sources) up to 38\% in ﬁnal energy consumption by 2020. While beneﬁting from local biomass resources Finnish energy system is deemed to achieve this goal, increasing the share of other intermittent renewables is under development, namely wind power and solar energy. Yet the maximum ﬂexibility of the existing energy system in integration of renewable energy is not investigated, which is an important step before undertaking new renewable energy obligations. This study aims at ﬁlling this gap by hourly analysis and comprehensive modeling of the energy system including electricity, heat, and transportation, by employing {EnergyPLAN} tool. Focusing on technical and economic implications, we assess the maximum potential of different {RESs} separately (including bioenergy, hydropower, wind power, solar heating and {PV}, and heat pumps), as well as an optimal mix of different technologies. Furthermore, we propose a new index for assessing the maximum ﬂexibility of energy systems in absorbing variable renewable energy. The results demonstrate that wind energy can be harvested at maximum levels of 18e19\% of annual power demand (approx. 16 {TWh}/a), without major enhancements in the ﬂexibility of energy infrastructure. With today's energy demand, the maximum feasible renewable energy for Finland is around 44e50\% by an optimal mix of different technologies, which promises 35\% reduction in carbon emissions from 2012's level. Moreover, Finnish energy system is ﬂexible to augment the share of renewables in gross electricity consumption up to 69 e72\%, at maximum. Higher shares of {RES} calls for lower energy consumption (energy efﬁciency) and more ﬂexibility in balancing energy supply and consumption (e.g. by energy storage).},

This paper analyses the impact on urban districts of decarbonizing the electric grid supply. A multi-objective optimization model has been developed that combines the optimal design and operation of distributed energy systems, the design of district heating ({DH}), electricity grid constraints based on linearized alternating current ({AC}) power ﬂow and grid upgrade options. A number of scenarios were deﬁned corresponding to different levels of renewable energy share in the electricity grid. For each scenario, we analyse the changes to the design and operation of the urban energy system, the impact on the district heating potential, and the impact on the operation of the distribution grid as well as the grid upgrade potential.},

	abstract = {Environmental and security concerns urge energy planners to design more sustainable energy systems, reducing fossil fuel consumptions in favour of renewable solutions. The proposed scenarios typically rely on a mixing of different energy sources, thereby mitigating the availability and intermittency problems typically related to renewable technologies. Optimizing this combination is of crucial importance to cope with economic, technical, and environmental issues, which typically give rise to multiple contradictory objectives. To this purpose, this article presents a generalized framework coupling {EnergyPLAN} – a descriptive analytical model for medium/large-scale energy systems – with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm – a type of optimizer widely used in the context of complex problems. By using this framework, it is possible to automatically identify a set of Pareto-optimal conﬁgurations with respect to different competing objectives. As an example, the method is applied to the case of Aalborg municipality, Denmark, by choosing cost and carbon emission minimization as contrasting goals. Results are compared with a manually identiﬁed scenario, taken from previous literature. The automatic approach, while conﬁrming that the available manual solution is very close to optimality, yields an entire set of additional optimal solutions, showing its effectiveness in the simultaneous analysis of a wide range of combinations.

Yet, the size and in particular the number of binary variables often may lead to difficulties for problem solution. In this work, the potential of genetic algorithms ({GA}) via a variant of {NSGA}-{II} is explored to cope with the multi-objective formulation, in order to produce compromise solutions automatically. The results obtained by using {GA} are compared to those presented in the base model as well as the computational effort to generate the solutions.

This problem is solved by implementing an -constraint method. The solution consists of a Pareto front, corresponding to different design strategies in the associated variable space. Multiple choice decision making is then recommended to ﬁnd the best solution through an M-{TOPSIS} analysis.

In particular, the authors describe a mixed-integer linear programming model that has been developed in order to optimally design and operate an energy system in a limited urban area where buildings are equipped with small-size {CHP} plants and are connected by a heat distribution network; in the proposed model a multi-objective function is optimized, since capital and operating costs, as well as {CO}2 emissions, are taken into account. The model has a general validity even if the results reported in the present paper are relative to the case study represented by a residential and tertiary district in the city of Arenzano in the North of Italy. Furthermore, a comparative study has been done in order to quantify the beneﬁts, in terms of economic saving and {CO}2 emission reduction, of having a combined heat and power distributed generation system in buildings in spite of using boilers to produce heat and of buying electricity from the grid.},

Mounting awareness of the climate crisis has placed increasing importance on developing renewable energy sources, however, advances in fossil fuel extraction technology have opened vast domestic reserves of oil and natural gas. Public preferences for energy policy play a role in determining energy futures, but researchers rarely simultaneously compare public views across multiple renewable and non-renewable energies or across country boundaries. Here, we used a 2019 online survey sample (n = 1500) to compare predictors of support for eight fuel sources for electricity generation in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington and Oregon, {USA}. Results indicate the highest support overall for renewables (wind, solar, wave/tidal energy, geothermal) and the lowest for fossil fuels (coal and natural gas), nuclear, and hydropower. Mixed-eﬀects regression modeling indicates that views on climate and the balance between environment and economy were consistent predictors of support across most energy types, while political ideology was less consistent. Perceived local importance of both extractive and renewable energy industries were signiﬁcant predictors of support for some, but not all, energy sources, as were education and gender. Overall, our research suggests that while divisions persist in public energy preferences for both renewable and non-renewable sources, there is the broadest support for renewable energy technologies.},

Awareness and certainty of impacts are the largest drivers of support level, followed by perceived impacts. Residents generally believe local offshore wind energy will improve local economies but damage the environment; however, perceived impacts vary by factor importance. About twice as many Carolina coast residents intend social action related to local offshore wind energy compared to those who have engaged in related past actions. Holding a strong position and engagement in past actions are the largest drivers of intended action. For those in strong opposition, increased place attachment increases the odds of intending action, suggesting place-protective action.

            Public support is a key determinant of whether any energy project is developed in democratic countries. In recent decades, scholars have extensively examined levels of support and opposition to energy infrastructure, often with a focus on so-called Not-in-My-Backyard ({NIMBY}) sentiments. As the need for energy infrastructure grows, so does the need to extract insights and lessons from this literature. In this systematic literature review, we evaluate decades of research to identify important trends in topical focus, research findings, and research design. We find a disproportionate focus on wind energy, followed by solar, fossil fuels, and transmission, with most studies conducted in the United States or United Kingdom, and that individuals are more often supportive of energy projects than they are opposed. Scholars have examined the role of many factors in understanding attitudes toward energy infrastructure, and often find knowledge, trust, and positive perceptions about the benefits of projects to be positively correlated with support for projects, although with variation across energy types. {NIMBY} attitudes differ widely in approach and are often plagued by problematic research designs that limit inferences and the generalizability of findings. We provide a detailed discussion of these limitations and suggest areas in which the literature can expand.},

Our approach examines a diverse set of energy projects in development, explicitly compares the attitudes of individuals living in the vicinity of projects with those farther away, and includes the careful measurement of the {NIMBY} concept. The analyses show little evidence that proximity in general or {NIMBY} objections in particular are important determinants of project support. Instead, other factors are more important, including perceptions of local environmental quality, risk orientation, concern about climate change, and trust in energy companies.},

Previous research has found that distributive and procedural justice issues are common factors inﬂuencing local public acceptance. This paper explores local public preferences for different forms of ﬁnancial and procedural participation by means of choice experiments and focus groups. The results show that wind power projects are generally accepted by the local public if certain condition, i.e. shareholding and high levels of participation in the decision-making process are oﬀered. Policy recommendations are given on how wind power projects should be implemented so as to counteract local opposition.

Using the Canadian province of Alberta – a context where oil and gas are politically and economically predominant –we assess these questions with a population-based survey experiment (n = 1591). Results indicate that energy transition is widely popular. Pre-existing values and beliefs about the economy; political identification with the left-right spectrum; worry about climate change; and hope in the future of oil and gas as a predominant industry strongly structure attitudes about transition. We argue that championing the economic benefits of clean energy will not be persuasive with people who continue to have high hopes in the future economic benefits of fossil fuels.

	abstract = {High-profile modelling studies often project that large-scale win–win solutions are widely available, but practitioners are often sceptical of win–win narratives, due to real-world complexity. Here we bridge this divide by showing mathematically why complexity makes win–wins elusive. We provide a general proof that increasing the number of objectives, the number of stakeholders or the number of constraints decreases the availability of win–win outcomes (here meaning Pareto improvements). We also show that a measure of tradeoff severity increases in the number of objectives. As the number of objectives approaches infinity, we show that this tradeoff severity measure approaches a limit unaffected by the curvature of the tradeoff surface. This is surprising because concave tradeoff-surface curvature results in less severe tradeoffs with fewer objectives. Our theory suggests that this difference gradually dissipates as objectives are added. In a meta-analysis, we show that 77\% of empirically estimated two-objective tradeoff surfaces are concave. We then show how to approximately extrapolate our tradeoff severity measure to higher numbers of objectives, starting from estimated tradeoffs between fewer objectives. Our results provide modellers with precise intuition into practitioners’ scepticism of win–win narratives and practitioners with guidance for assessing the implications of simple tradeoff models.},

This effort relies heavily on renewable electricity and calls for a transition that is: (i) flexible enough to accommodate existing and new electricity end uses and users; (ii) resilient in response to climate change and other threats to electricity infrastructure; (iii) cost-effective in comparison to alternatives; and (iv) just in the face of energy systems that are often the result of—or the cause of—procedural, distributive, and historical injustices. Acknowledging the intertwined roles of technology and policy, this work provides a cross-disciplinary review of how microgrids may contribute to renewable electricity systems that are flexible, resilient, cost-effective, and just (including illustrative examples from Korea, California, New York, the European Union, and elsewhere). Following this review of generalized microgrid characteristics, we more closely examine the role and potential of microgrids in two United States jurisdictions that have adopted 100\% renewable electricity standards (Hawai‘i and Puerto Rico), and which are actively developing regulatory regimes putatively designed to enable renewable microgrids. Collectively, this review shows that although microgrids have the potential to support the transition to 100\% renewable electricity in a variety of ways, the emerging policy structures require substantial further development to operationalize that potential. We conclude that unresolved fundamental policy tensions arise from justice considerations, such as how to distribute the benefits and burdens of microgrid infrastructure, rather than from technical questions about microgrid topologies and operating characteristics. Nonetheless, technical and quantitative future research will be necessary to assist regulators as they develop microgrid policies. In particular, there is a need to develop socio–techno–economic analyses of cost-effectiveness, which consider a broad range of potential benefits and costs.},

In {HE}, socio-technical thinking is fundamental as {HE} projects exist at the intersection of engineering and sustainable community development. However, the literature still lacks an understanding of the key features of socio-technical thinking. Purpose/Hypothesis The purpose of this article is to investigate the key characteristics that distinguish the socio-technical thinking of an expert from a novice in the context of {HE} projects. Design/Method We distributed the Energy Conversion Playground ({ECP}) design task to students starting their engineering degree (n = 26) and practitioners (n = 16). We iteratively and inductively analyzed the responses to develop a rubric characterizing the key features of expert socio-technical thinking. We then scored participants' responses and compared them to identify differences between students and practitioners. Results The analysis showed that expert socio-technical thinkers can provide high-quality considerations across three domains: technology, people, and broader context. The comparison of the participants' scores showed that both students and practitioners scored highly in the technology domain. In contrast, students scored poorly in the people and broader contexts domains, identifying only simplistic considerations in these non-technical areas, if at all. Conclusions This study provides novel insights into the development of socio-technical thinking and further validates the {ECP} as a trustworthy measure of socio-technical thinking. Implications for engineering educators and multiple lines of future research are also discussed.},

The challenge is more acute given the projected doubling of global energy consumption by 2050 and widespread electrification of transportation and industry. Yet unlike greenhouse gas emissions, land use intensity of energy has been rarely studied in a rigorous way. Here we calculate land-use intensity of energy ({LUIE}) for real-world sites across all major sources of electricity, integrating data from published literature, databases, and original data collection. We find a range of {LUIE} that span four orders of magnitude, from nuclear with 7.1 ha/{TWh}/y to dedicated biomass at 58,000 ha/{TWh}/y. By applying these {LUIE} results to the future electricity portfolios of ten energy scenarios, we conclude that land use could become a significant constraint on deep decarbonization of the power system, yet low-carbon, land-efficient options are available.},

	abstract = {Decarbonizing the United States energy system is a challenging task. The situation is exacerbated by the lack of strong federal climate policy, leaving individual states and institutions to drive the energy sector towards net-zero carbon emissions. {ESOM} tools use linear programming to develop policy insights that may help achieve full decarbonization. However, there is a widely recognized tradeoff between model complexity and computational cost. Adding spatial, temporal, and technological details make these models more realistic, but may make them computationally intractable. Previously, most {ESOM} studies prioritize technology options over spatial or temporal detail. This choice emphasizes the role of technology costs, such as fuel and capital costs, on energy policy without considering operational challenges. This thesis uses the {ESOM}, Temoa to model Illinois’ and the University of Illinois’ energy systems and develops the {PyGenesys} tool to facilitate sensitivity analysis. The sensitivities considered in this work are temporal resolution and the annual capacity factors of wind and solar energy, or the inter-annual variability.

The results of the time resolution study showed that any temporal aggregation above an hourly level may generate misleading results that minimizes the roles of firm clean power and energy storage. Additionally, the role of wind energy is overestimated in models with less temporal detail, and the roles of solar energy and advanced nuclear reactors are underestimated. The study of inter-annual variability showed that energy systems with majority variable intermittent renewables, such as solar and wind, that exclude clean firm power from nuclear power plants exhibit higher energy costs with nearly 63 times the variance of systems that use a majority of clean firm power. Additionally, the amount of capacity necessary to meet electricity demand is greater and more uncertain in systems with high renewable penetration. Finally, based on the results in each of the sensitivity analyses, this thesis recommends that Illinois continues supporting its existing nuclear fleet with “zero emissions credits” and expand clean firm capacity with advanced nuclear reactors by lifting the moratorium on new nuclear builds.},

Theconstruction of the 1,172-mile pipeline raised questions about the public’s ability to influence energy infrastructure development considered by the {US} government as “critical” to national security. While numerous scholars and courts have begun to question whether thefederalregulatory process that permitted {DAPL} sufficiently allowed for participation, less work has examinedstate-levelprocesses. In this article, we ask whether actors who participated in the regulatory process at the state-level had sufficient opportunity to influence the siting, permitting, and construction of {DAPL}. We focus on Illinois, analyzing the 2015 proceeding by the Illinois Commerce Commission ({ICC}) to permit {DAPL}. Drawing on fieldwork between October 2018 and May 2020, we argue the {ICC} regulatory process minimized the space available for pipeline opposition in three ways. First, the {ICC} is limited, in an institutional design sense, from integrating broad public opinion into its decision-making process. Second, as a function of its design, pipeline opponents required significant knowledge and resources to mount claims before the {ICC}. Finally, we contend that politically powerful interest groups, especially labor unions and industry stakeholders, shape pipeline politics in Illinois in ways that further limit avenues for formal opposition. Our work raises important questions about the impact of public participation in contemporary energy and environmental governance, as well as how democratic contestation surrounding oil pipelines can openspacefor resistance and transformativesocial change.},

	abstract = {Low-carbon generating technologies vary significantly in the employment that
they create.
Employment is created largely during the construction stage and throughout
the network of supply chain companies needed to maintain operations.
Most employment estimates in the sector are ‘point-in-time’, i.e. they provide
a snapshot rather than a view over the entire plant lifetime. The rapid growth
of wind power thus distorts the contribution it might make in a ‘steady state’ of
neither growth nor decline.
This paper uses existing studies for specified countries to estimate employment
in a steady state for both nuclear and wind energy.
By separating employment into several distinct stages – construction;
operations and maintenance; supply chain; and decommissioning – a steady
state employment estimate is presented for the generation of 1000 {TWh} of
electricity over a year. On the basis of data from France and the {USA}, for this
amount of electricity nuclear creates 461,000 jobs to wind’s 346,000 jobs, i.e.
about 25\% more employment per unit of electricity than wind power.
Other attractive features of nuclear sector employment include comparatively
good pay, long-term job security and a high degree of localisation in the
host country.
Although nuclear generation requires significant investment in employment,
it maintains a competitive advantage over intermittent sources of low-carbon
electricity such as wind. As a highly reliable and stable source of electricity,
nuclear generation does not require additional investment in backup capacity
or storage, while investments in grids are relatively low. When the total costs
of the plant and system are taken into account, nuclear offers not only more

The prevailing consensus among movement scholars is that the prospect for movement emergence is facilitated by the confluence of three factors: the expansion of political opportunities, the availability of mobilizing structures, and cognitive and affective mobilization through framing processes. The author then applies each of these factors to the case of climate change, arguing that (a) awareness of the issue developed during an especially inopportune period in American politics, (b) the organizations that arose to address the issue were ill suited to the kind of grassroots mobilization characteristic of successful movements, and (c) the amorphous nature of the issue played havoc with efforts at strategic framing.},

This paper presents an empirical test of these guidelines. A questionnaire based on the Credo was completed by stakeholders in 29 waste facility siting cases, both successful and unsuccessful, across the United States and Canada. Using an independent determination of outcome (success), a preliminary ranking of the importance of various Credo principles was obtained. The data reveal that establishing trust between the developer and host community is an important factor in facilitating the siting process. The siting process is most likely to be successful when the community perceives the facility design to be appropriate and to satisfy its needs. Public participation also is seen to be an important process variable, particularly if it encourages a view that the facility best meets community needs. Moreover, a siting process where communities volunteer to host facilities is an approach that holds promise for meeting many of these key success criteria.},

	abstract = {As energy systems decarbonize, their environmental impacts will change. Historically, energy consumption has been a reliable proxy for environmental impacts of interest due to the dominance of fossil fuel combustion. With a normative transition to decarbonized energy, however, environmental assessment of energy systems faces two major paradigm shifts: 1) environmental profiles are likely to be dominated by embodied rather than operational impacts; and 2) the primary analytical need is for prospective and trustworthy analysis to support system design decisions. Ensuring that analysis of diverse potential decarbonized futures is rigorous and granted legitimacy by potential users is critical if such analysis is to be used and useful as decision support. This review uses both computational and narrative methods to evaluate the English language literature on 12 environmental impact categories and 18 types of decarbonized energy resources or energy carriers to ask: what issues does environmental assessment need to be able to rigorously evaluate to support decisions about designing a decarbonized energy supply? We find that embodied impacts are likely to dominate. We suggest that land use metrics might displace energy consumption as the best single proxy for overall energy supply system impacts, though translating land use inventory data to environmental impacts requires significantly more contextualization than does fossil fuel combustion. Individual energy resources or energy carriers have diverse potential environmental impacts that are highly context dependent and dynamic under technological and environmental change, which suggests that mitigation pathways might depend on project design choices more than technological mitigation.},

	abstract = {As the energy system changes, metrics used to describe energy use for modelling, socioenvironmental assessment, and other applications should be continually evaluated to ensure ongoing relevance and applicability. Decarbonization highlights the need for fit-for-purpose assessment tools as energy systems undergo an expected transition from mostly fossil to mostly nonfossil resources. Energy use has historically been a high-quality proxy for socioenvironmental impacts of interest, but this characteristic depends on the relatively stable historical relationship between energy use (typically measured as exchanges of marketed energy resources and carriers like natural gas and electricity) and these impacts—a relationship that is increasingly weak. Already, energy use metrics used in tools like energy footprinting and life cycle assessment have developed maladaptations to include nonfossil resources, including many flow resources. For example, nonmarketed energy use is typically ignored; metrics like heat rate are applied to nonthermal resources in ways with limited physical meaning; and definitional exceptions are made without clear justification. Part of the challenge is that energy is a conserved quantity with highly variable quality, but energy footprint metrics have historically implicitly assumed that all energy, and energy use, is the same. The assessment community can improve the clarity and value of energy use quantification under decarbonization by drawing on the experience of footprinting with another highly heterogeneous conserved resource: water. This discussion introduces the concept of a yellow, red, and brown energy footprint framework as an expansion of traditional energy footprinting and analogue of the green, blue, and grey water footprinting framework.},

	abstract = {The shift from carbon-intensive to low-carbon energy systems has profound justice implications as some regions are likely to lose as much as gain from decarbonization processes. Increasing calls have been made to adopt a ‘whole systems’ perspective on energy justice. Drawing on the Multi-level Perspective on socio-technical transitions this paper presents a new comprehensive framework of energy justice in system innovation, proposing to map injustices along three dimensions: 1) multiple spatial scales (regional, national, international); 2) different time horizons (currently experienced vs. anticipated injustices); 3) connections to transition dynamics (injustices related to the optimization of the currently dominant system, destabilization of the incumbent system or the acceleration of alternative solutions in niches). The framework is applied to analyse the ongoing energy transition in Estonia, involving interactions between the incumbent oil shale based regime and wind, solar, nuclear and bioenergy as emerging niche challengers. The content analysis of news items in Estonian media reveals an inventory of 214 distinct incidents of energy injustices across 21 different categories. We find that many experienced and anticipated injustices are deployed, often strategically, by certain actors to advocate specific energy futures and to influence current political choices. From the justice perspective our analysis thus raises a question whether it is ethical to use probable yet currently unrealized injustices related to regime destabilization and niche acceleration as a means to perpetuate injustices related to the optimization of the currently dominant regime.},

	abstract = {Despite recent technical advances, there is a risk that commercial-scale fusion will not play a substantial role in mitigating climate change or alleviating energy poverty due to a lack of public or community support, often referred to as a lack of a social license. This risk is not academic—other technologies, such as fission reactors, spent fuel waste repositories (e.g., Yucca Mountain), genetically modified foods, onshore and offshore wind turbines, electrical transmission lines, and even vaccines, struggle due to rejection by a substantial fraction of society, in other words, a lack of social acceptance. Conventional approaches to this challenge, such as risk-reducing technical solutions (e.g., replacing fission with fusion), or better “communication” or “education,” are unlikely, on their own, to be sufficient to mitigate this risk. Fortunately, fusion is sufficiently young that it has an opportunity to distinguish itself from other energy technologies not just in the way that it uses physics, but also in the way that it approaches society. In particular, fusion can anticipate, rather than react to, public concerns. Looking to other industries and fields of research, this paper describes the risk of a lack of public support and methods to achieve such support, including a social license, bio-ethical review, and responsible research and innovation. These methods are discussed in the context of seven case studies, illustrating practical application. The paper concludes with recommendations for specific steps that fusion companies, non-governmental organizations, academic researchers, government funders, and government regulators can take now to facilitate a long-term social license for fusion energy.},

Accelerated technological progress and policy implementations are required to deliver emissions reductions at rates sufficiently fast to avoid crossing dangerous tipping points in the Earth’s climate system. Here, we discuss and evaluate the potential of social tipping interventions ({STIs}) that can activate contagious processes of rapidly spreading technologies, behaviors, social norms, and structural reorganization within their functional domains that we refer to as social tipping elements ({STEs}). {STEs} are subdomains of the planetary socioeconomic system where the required disruptive change may take place and lead to a sufficiently fast reduction in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The results are based on online expert elicitation, a subsequent expert workshop, and a literature review. The {STIs} that could trigger the tipping of {STE} subsystems include 1) removing fossil-fuel subsidies and incentivizing decentralized energy generation ({STE}1, energy production and storage systems), 2) building carbon-neutral cities ({STE}2, human settlements), 3) divesting from assets linked to fossil fuels ({STE}3, financial markets), 4) revealing the moral implications of fossil fuels ({STE}4, norms and value systems), 5) strengthening climate education and engagement ({STE}5, education system), and 6) disclosing information on greenhouse gas emissions ({STE}6, information feedbacks).

Assessing energy justice in contexts with high cultural and ecological diversity as well as high levels of marginalisation, and a post-colonial history (of domination and resistance to it), requires taking into account the local contextual understandings of justice. Current literature, however, has been mostly developed under the evidence and concepts of Global North contexts, which tend to build in universal ideas of justice, often inappropriate for policy application in the Global South. To contribute to closing this gap, the paper qualitatively analyses the implementation of a large-scale photovoltaic project in Yucatan, Mexico, examining how neighbouring indigenous communities and other key actors perceive, experience and react to procedural and socio-environmental justice issues in the project's implementation. Results show that commonly-used concepts such as consent, participation and inclusion -as currently applied in the siting of renewable infrastructure- are now mostly perceived as legitimation of projects that align with the developer and governmental priorities. Emphasising self-determination over and above the aforementioned concepts is seen as a priority among affected communities for achieving a more socially just energy transition.},

Here we analyse the authors’ methodology and find it problematic. The feasibility criteria chosen by the authors are important, but are also easily addressed at low economic cost, while not affecting the main conclusions of the reviewed studies and certainly not affecting their technical feasibility. A more thorough review reveals that all of the issues have already been addressed in the engineering and modelling literature. Nuclear power, which the authors have evaluated positively elsewhere, faces other, genuine feasibility problems, such as the finiteness of uranium resources and a reliance on unproven technologies in the medium- to long-term. Energy systems based on renewables, on the other hand, are not only feasible, but already economically viable and decreasing in cost every year.},

Yet the literature offers a rather wide range of estimates for the price elasticities of demand for energy. This paper quantitatively summarizes the recent, but sizeable, empirical evidence to facilitate a sounder economic assessment of (in some cases policy-related) energy price changes.

Instrumental variable models using the between estimator, as well as dynamic panel models are employed to present robust estimates, and to assess the impact of different methodologies on the reported elasticities. The long-run price elasticity of residential electricity consumption is estimated between −0.53 and −0.56. These elasticities are more inelastic than that of industrial electricity use, which is reported between −0.75 and −1.01. The choice of different econometric methodologies has only moderate impact on the estimates. While long-run residential income elasticity estimates are moderately inelastic and estimated around 0.61, industrial electricity use tends to be closely tied to income, with elasticities between 0.76 and 1.08. Electricity demand in all sectors is highly price and income inelastic in the short run. Additionally, population density, temperatures, and policy measures also influence sectoral electricity use. The above estimates can aid the design of European energy and environmental policy.},

Accelerating access to electricity requires, inter alia, strategies and programmes that effectively address and account for the geographical, infrastructural and socioeconomic characteristics of a country or region. This paper focuses on considering these characteristics by developing a Geographic Information Systems ({GIS})-based methodology to inform electriﬁcation planning and strategies. The methodology is applied to Nigeria in order to identify the optimal mix of electriﬁcation options, ranging from grid extensions to mini-grid and off-grid solutions. The case study illustrates how this optimal mix is inﬂuenced by a range of parameters—including population density, existing and planned transmission networks and power plants, economic activities, tariffs for grid-based electricity, technology costs for mini-grid and off-grid systems and fuel costs for consumers. For a certain level of energy access, on-grid connections would be optimal for the majority of the new connections in Nigeria; grid extension constitutes the lowest cost option for approximately 86\% of the newly electriﬁed population in this modelling effort with 2030 as the time horizon. However, there are some remote areas with low population densities where a mini-grid or a stand-alone solution are the most economic options; deploying some combination of solar, wind, hydro and diesel technologies depending on the locational resource availability.},

It includes a wide range of features and constraints, such as stochastic parameters, multiple reserve products, energy storage units, controlled and uncontrolled energy transfers, and, most significantly, multiple energy sectors. The formulation is based on mixed-integer programming and takes into account unit commitment decisions for power plants and other energy conversion facilities. Both high-level large-scale systems and fully detailed smaller-scale systems can be appropriately modelled. The framework has been implemented as the open-source Backbone modelling tool using General Algebraic Modeling System ({GAMS}). An application of the framework is demonstrated using a power system example, and Backbone is shown to produce results comparable to a commercial tool. However, the adaptability of Backbone further enables the creation and solution of energy systems models relatively easily for many different purposes and thus it improves on the available methodologies.},

	abstract = {Using a linear cost minimization model with a 1 h time resolution, we investigated the influence of geographic allocation of wind power on large-scale wind power investments, taking into account wind conditions, distance to load, and the nature of the power system in place (i.e. power generation and transmission capacities). We employed a hypothetical case in which a 20\% wind power share of total electricity demand is applied to the Nordic–German power system. Free, i.e. geographically unrestricted, allocation of new wind power capacity is compared with a case in which national planning frameworks impose national limitations on wind power penetration levels. Given the cost assumptions made in the present work, the prospect of increasing the wind power capacity factor from 20 to 30\% could motivate investments in transmission capacity from northern Scandinavia to continental Europe. The results obtained using the model show that the distribution of wind farms between regions with favorable wind conditions is dependent upon two factors: (i) the extent to which existing lines can be used to transmit the electricity that results from the new wind power and (ii) the correlation for wind power generation between the exporting region and the wind power generation already in place. In addition, the results indicate that there is little difference, i.e. just over 1\%, in total yearly cost between the free allocation of new wind power and an allocation that complies with national planning frameworks. However, on a national level, there are significant differences with respect to investments in transmission and wind power capacities and the replacement of conventional power generation.

However, most publicly available test systems are of insufficient fidelity for developing methods and tools for high-resolution planning. This paper presents methods to construct open-access test systems of high spatial resolution to more accurately represent infrastructure and high temporal resolution to represent dynamics of demand and variable resources. To demonstrate, a high-resolution test system representing the United States is created using only publicly available data. This test system is validated by running it in a production cost model, with results compared against historical generation to ensure that they are representative. The resulting open source test system can support power system transition planning and aid in development of tools to answer questions around how best to reach decarbonization goals, using the most effective combinations of transmission expansion, renewable generation, and energy storage.},

However, previous research falls short in addressing the risks that joint uncertainties in these processes pose in power systems and wholesale electricity markets. Limiting challenges have included the large areal extents of power systems, high temporal resolutions (hourly or sub-hourly), and the data volumes and computational intensities required. This paper introduces an open source modeling framework for evaluating risks from correlated hydrometeorological processes in electricity markets at decision relevant scales. The framework is able to reproduce historical price dynamics in high profile systems, while also offering unique capabilities for stochastic simulation. Synthetic generation of weather and hydrologic variables is coupled with simulation models of relevant infrastructure (dams, power plants). Our model will allow the role of hydrometeorological uncertainty (including compound extreme events) on electricity market outcomes to be explored using publicly available models.},

	abstract = {National demand for electricity follows a regular and predictable daily pattern. This pattern is set to change due to efficiency improvements, de-industrialisation and electrification of heat and transport. These changes are independent of renewable infeed and are not well understood: contemporary studies assume that electricity load curves will retain their current shape, scaling equally in all hours. Changes to this shape will profoundly affect the electricity industry: increasing the requirements for flexible and peaking capacity, and reducing asset utilisation and profitability. This paper explores the evolution of load curves to 2050 in Germany and Britain: two countries undergoing radically different energy transformations. It reviews recent developments in Europe's electricity demand, and introduces two models for synthesising future hourly load curves: {eLOAD} (electricity {LOad} curve {ADjustment}) and {DESSTinEE} (Demand for Energy Services, Supply and Transmission in {EuropE}). Both models are applied to a decarbonisation scenario for 2050, and consistently show peak loads increasing by about 23\% points above the change in annual demand, to 103 {GW} in Germany and 92 {GW} in Britain. Sensitivities around electrification show that a million extra heat pumps or electric vehicles add up to 1.5 {GW} to peak demand. The structure and shape of the future load curves are analysed, and impacts on the national electricity systems are drawn.},

	abstract = {To tackle the climate crisis, the European energy strategy relies on consumers taking ownership of the energy transition, accelerating decarbonisation through investments in low-carbon technologies and ensuring system stability and reliability by actively participating in the market. Therefore, tools are needed to better understand an increasingly complex and actor-dense energy system, tracking socio-technical dynamics that occur at its margins and then predicting the effects on larger scales. Yet, existing domestic energy demand models are not flexible enough to incorporate a wide range of socio-technical factors, and to be incorporated into larger energy system simulation environments. Here, a co-simulation design for domestic energy demand modeling is presented and motivated on the basis of four design principles: granularity, scalability, modularity and transparency. Microsimulation of domestic energy demand, through the Python open source library demod, shows that it is possible to achieve high detail and high temporal resolution without compromising scalability. Furthermore, mosaik, an open source co-simulation framework, makes it possible to generate, integrate and orchestrate a multitude of demod-based instances with other independent models, which for the illustrative purposes of this study are represented by a heat pump model. The authors hope that the detailed documentation of the proposed solution will encourage interdisciplinary and collaborative efforts to develop a simulation ecosystem capable of investigating alternative energy transition pathways and evaluating policy interventions through the socio-technical lens.},

	abstract = {Many studies have demonstrated the feasibility of fully renewable power systems. Yet the future costs of key technologies are highly uncertain, and little is known about the robustness of a renewable power system to these uncertainties. To analyze it, we build 315 cost scenarios by varying the costs of key technologies and we model the optimal renewable power system for France, simultaneously optimizing investment and dispatch. We add to the literature by studying a consecutive 18-years weather period; by testing all combinations of technology costs rather than changing them one-at-a-time; and by calculating the regret from optimizing the energy mix on the basis of cost assumptions that do not materialize. Our results indicate that the cost of a 100\% system is not that sensitive to uncertainty. Admittedly, the optimal energy mix is highly sensitive to cost assumptions: across our scenarios, the installed capacity in {PV}, onshore wind and power-to-gas varies by a factor of 5, batteries and offshore wind even more. However, in every scenario the total production and storage cost is similar to, or lower than the current cost. This indicates that renewable technologies will become by and large substitutable. Moreover, even if the energy mix is optimized based on cost assumptions which turn out to be wrong, the extra cost is low: 4\% in average and less than 9\% in 95\% of the scenarios.},

Integrating these new energy resources and technologies will lead to profound structural changes in energy systems, such as an increasing need for storage and a radical electrification of the heating and mobility sectors. To capture the increasing complexity of such future energy systems, new flexible and open-source optimization modelling tools are needed.
This paper presents {EnergyScope} {TD}, a novel open-source model for the strategic energy planning of urban and regional energy systems. Compared to other existing energy models, which are often proprietary, computationally expensive and mostly focused on the electricity sector, {EnergyScope} {TD} optimises both the investment and operating strategy of an entire energy system (including electricity, heating and mobility). Additionally, its hourly resolution (using typical days) makes the model suitable for the integration of intermittent renewables, and its concise mathematical formulation and computational efficiency are appropriate for uncertainty applications. We present the linear programming model, detailing its formulation, and we apply it to a real-world case study to discuss advantages and disadvantages in comparison to other modelling frameworks. In particular, we model the national energy system of Switzerland to evaluate a 50\% renewable energy scenario.},

	abstract = {Planning of sustainable Urban Energy Systems is a challenging task for the many involved stakeholders which requires optimal use of available knowledge for decision support. Therefore, systematic approaches integrating energy models and interactively linking them to real-world data are highly required. In this regard, Geographic Information Systems (called {GIS}) offer as a platform many advantages and can play a significant role in integrating renewable energy sources at the urban scale. The optimal integration and placement of different possible flexibilisation technologies such as storage can profit from the possibilities offered by {GIS} tools. In addition, {GIS} facilitate policy making, allowing for a realistic and multilayer representation of urban energy systems. This contribution first draws an overview of {GIS}-based models for urban energy systems by investigating the current state of modelling. It introduces in a second step, an outline of a transferable {GIS}-based platform for the optimisation of storage and other flexibilisation technologies in urban areas. The model is composed of three main components and deals with the optimal integration of flexibilisation technologies. The fields of applications of the model are, but not restricted to, analysis of the emergence of sustainable cities, self-consumption at the urban levels, autarky measures, capacity demand and economic efficiency, and the integration of flexibility options. The method developed by the authors and presented here deals with the first component of the proposed model which is setting up the spatial framework. The framework relies mainly on spatial features of urban objects extracted from the open source {OpenStreetMap} database. The different steps involved in the spatial framework set-up are extraction and filtering of the data sets and their algorithmic steps which will be introduced here in details. A central finding of this contribution illustrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using open source data and tools to replicate urban energy features.},

Apart from the benefit of reducing {CO}2 emissions and, potentially, system cost, wind power is associated with negative impacts at the local level, such as interference with landscape aesthetics. Some of these impacts might be avoided by using alternative renewable energy technologies. Thus, we quantify the opportunity cost of wind power versus its best feasible alternative solar photovoltaics, using the power system model medea. Our findings suggest that the cost of undisturbed landscapes is considerable, particularly when solar {PV} is mainly realized on roof-tops. Under a wide range of assumptions, the opportunity cost of wind power is high enough to allow for significant compensation of the ones affected by local, negative wind turbine externalities.},

	abstract = {The adoption of electric vehicles is incentivized by governments around the world to decarbonize the mobility sector. Simultaneously, the continuously increasing amount of renewable energy sources and electric devices such as heat pumps and electric vehicles leads to congested grids. To meet this challenge, several forms of flexibility markets are currently being researched. So far, no analysis has calculated the actual flexibility potential of electric vehicles with different operating strategies, electricity tariffs and charging power levels while taking into account realistic user behavior. Therefore, this paper presents a detailed case study of the flexibility potential of electric vehicles for fixed and dynamic prices, for three charging power levels in consideration of Californian and German user behavior. The model developed uses vehicle and mobility data that is publicly available from field trials in the {USA} and Germany, cost-optimizes the charging process of the vehicles, and then calculates the flexibility of each electric vehicle for every 15 min. The results show that positive flexibility is mostly available during either the evening or early morning hours. Negative flexibility follows the periodic vehicle availability at home if the user chooses to charge the vehicle as late as possible. Increased charging power levels lead to increased amounts of flexibility. Future research will focus on the integration of stochastic forecasts for vehicle availability and electricity tariffs.},

For this purpose, {POMATO} implements methods for the analysis of simultaneous zonal market clearing, nodal (N-k secure) power flow computation for capacity allocation, and multi-stage market clearing with adaptive grid representation and redispatch. The computationally demanding N-k secure power flow is enabled via an efficient constraint reduction algorithm. {POMATO} provides an integrated environment for data read-in, pre- and post-processing and interactive result visualization. Comprehensive data sets of European electricity systems compiled from Open Power System Data and Matpower Cases are part of the distribution. {POMATO} is implemented in Python and Julia, leveraging Python’s easily maintainable data processing and user interaction features and Julia’s well readable algebraic modeling language, superior computational performance and interfaces to open-source and commercial solvers.},

	abstract = {{PowNet} is a free modelling tool for simulating the Unit Commitment/Economic Dispatch of large-scale power systems. {PowNet} is specifically conceived for systems characterized by the presence of variable renewable resources (e.g., hydropower, solar, and wind), whose penetration on the grid is strongly influenced by climatic variability and constrained by the availability of transmission capacity. To help users effectively capture the nuances of power system dynamics, {PowNet} is equipped with features that enable accuracy, transferability, and computational efficiency over large spatial and temporal domains. Specifically, the model (i) accounts for the techno-economic constraints of both generating units and transmission networks, (ii) can be easily coupled with models that estimate the status of generating units as a function of the climatic conditions, and (iii) explicitly includes import/export nodes, which are useful in representing cross-border systems. {PowNet} is implemented in Python and is compatible with any standard optimization solver (e.g., Gurobi, {CPLEX}). Its functionality is demonstrated on the Cambodian power system.

However, the uncertainty about wind generation affects existing network infrastructure and power production planning of generators, which cannot be fully diminished by wind forecasts. In this paper we develop a stochastic electricity market model to analyze the impact of uncertain wind generation on the different electricity markets as well as network congestion management. Stochastic programming techniques are used to incorporate uncertain wind generation. The technical characteristics of transporting electrical energy as well as power plants are explicitly taken into account. The consecutive clearing of the electricity markets is incorporated by a rolling planning procedure reflecting the market regime of European markets. The model is applied to the German electricity system covering one week. Two different approaches of considering uncertain wind generation are analyzed and compared to a deterministic approach. The results reveal that the flexibility of generation dispatch is increased either by using more flexible generation technologies or by operating rather inflexible technologies under part-load conditions.},

Switch is capable of long-, medium- and short-term planning of investments and operations with conventional or smart grids, integrating large shares of renewable power, storage and/or demand response. Applications include integrated resource planning, investment planning, economic and policy analyses as well as basic research. Potential users include researchers, educators, industry and regulators. Switch formulates generation and transmission capacity planning as a mixed integer linear program where investment and operation are co-optimized across sampled time series during multiple investment periods. High-resolution production cost modeling is supported by freezing investment decisions and including longer time series and more operational details. Modeling features include unit commitment, part-load efficiency, planning and operating reserves, fuel supply curves, storage, hydroelectric networks, policy constraints and demand response. Switch has a modular architecture that allows users to flexibly compose models by choosing built-in modules 'a la carte' or writing custom modules. This paper describes the software architecture and model formulation of Switch 2.0 and provides a case study in which the model was used to identify the best options for obtaining load-shifting and reserve services from batteries and demand response in a 100\% renewable power system.},

The reviewed literatures show that there are still issues which could be considered in estimation of the {VOLL}, especially for industrial customers. One of the most interesting issues is inclusion of reliability of an industrial plant in estimation of the {VOLL}. This means that how reliability data of the plant components (failure rates, repair time, etc.) can be incorporated in the studies to provide a probabilistic model for the {VOLL} and its related quantities. This paper incorporates failure probability in the {VOLL} estimation of an industrial plant. For this purpose, firstly an estimate for failure rate of the plant components is obtained and secondly, this estimate is applied in failure probability function which is to be incorporated in the {VOLL}.

This paper improves on prior work by clearly distinguishing applications of the {VoLL} metric between (1) cost-benefit analyses which inform centralized, reliability-enhancing infrastructure investments and (2) decentralized rationing decisions during times of electric supply shortage. Revealed preference approaches to {VoLL} estimation are introduced that offer attractive theoretical advantages over traditional estimation methods.

	abstract = {This paper compares various flexibility options to support renewable energy integration across the energy transition using energy system modelling. We analyse new flexibility assets such as electricity storage, heat pumps, demand-side response with existing wet appliances, electric boilers for domestic hot water and distribution grid expansion, along with energy efficiency measures in electrical appliances and building retrofitting. We propose an open-source sector coupling model ({GRIMSEL}-{FLEX}) to minimise, from a social planner perspective, the total cost of the energy system for electricity and residential heating supply in Switzerland, including various types of consumers and urban settings. We find relevant feedback mechanisms among various flexibility options. Firstly, electric boilers have a larger flexibility potential than demand-side response with wet appliances since they reduce storage investments by more than 26\% by 2050 (only 12\% for demand-side response). Secondly, 34\% more electricity storage is needed if heat pumps replace all fossil-based heating and 80\% to replace all heating systems entirely. Thirdly, we find a shift in the operation of heat pumps, electric boilers and wet appliances from night to midday, resulting in larger photovoltaic deployment (22\%–66\% for the residential sector). Finally, electricity storage capacity induced by heat pump deployment is highly dependent on the retrofitting rate. With 1\% per annum, 86\% of storage investments can be avoided and it can be counterbalanced with a high retrofitting rate of 2\% per annum.},

It simulates investment, dispatch, and trade, minimizing total costs subject to a large set of technical constraints. In economics terms, it is a partial equilibrium model of the wholesale electricity market. It calculates scenario-based or green-field optima (equilibria) and estimates the corresponding capacity mix as well as hourly prices, generation, storage dispatch, flexible consumption, and cross-border trade for each market area. Technically, {EMMA} is a linear program, written in {GAMS} and solved by {CPLEX} on a desktop computer in about two hours. {EMMA} has been used for a number of peer-reviewed publications as well as in consulting projects. {EMMA} is open-source: the model code and input data are freely available under the {MIT} Software License and the Create Commons {BY}-{SA} 4.0 License, respectively, and can be downloaded from https://github.com/emma-model},

	abstract = {This paper presents a detailed mixed-integer linear optimization model for capacity-expansion planning and unit commitment of a factory's distributed energy supply system. The model identifies the cost-optimal configurations of specified energy-conversion processes and storage techniques to cover the factory's energy demand. The general formulation of the model allows it to deal with a large number of energy-system structures. The main constraint of the model is that it must cover given demand time series for different commodities such as electricity, heating and cooling. For each commodity, storage units with different technical and economic parameters as well as a possible external connection considering time-sensitive prices for import/export and peak demand charges can be defined. The model allows the users to specify processes, for converting between the different types of commodities. The conversion processes can handle multiple inputs and outputs and consider part-load performance as well as start-up behavior. The objective of the model is to find the optimal design and operation of the industrial energy system with minimal investment and operational costs. A case study based on the measured electric- and heat-demand time series of four different factories is presented, investigating the economic efficiency of combined heat and power ({CHP}) units and battery storage systems. The results show, that the decision as to whether {CHP} units are used, mainly depends on the relationship between gas and electricity costs, while the load profile of the factories and the applied pricing program only influence their size. Batteries are only considered in the results when their investment costs are reduced and they have little influence on the total cost.},

A key feature of the {OSeMOSYS} implementation is that it is contained in less than five pages of documented, easily accessible code. Other existing energy system models that do not have this emphasis on compactness and openness makes the barrier to entry by new users much higher, as well as making the addition of innovative new functionality very difficult. The paper begins by describing the rationale for the development of {OSeMOSYS} and its structure. The current preliminary implementation of the model is then demonstrated for a discrete example. Next, we explain how new development efforts will build on the existing {OSeMOSYS} codebase. The paper closes with thoughts regarding the organization of the {OSeMOSYS} community, associated capacity development efforts, and linkages to other open source efforts including adding functionality to the {LEAP} model.},

	abstract = {Energy system models have become indispensable tools for planning future energy systems by providing insights into different development trajectories. However, sustainable systems with high shares of renewable energy are characterized by growing cross-sectoral interdependencies and decentralized structures. To capture important properties of increasingly complex energy systems, sophisticated and flexible modelling tools are needed. At the same time, open science is becoming increasingly important in energy system modelling. This paper presents the Open Energy Modelling Framework (oemof) as a novel approach to energy system modelling, representation and analysis. The framework provides a toolbox to construct comprehensive energy system models and has been published open source under a free licence. Through collaborative development based on open processes, the framework supports a maximum level of participation, transparency and open science principles in energy system modelling. Based on a generic graph-based description of energy systems, it is well-suited to flexibly model complex cross-sectoral systems and incorporate various modelling approaches. This makes the framework a multi-purpose modelling environment for modelling and analyzing different systems at scales ranging from urban to transnational.},

	abstract = {Variable renewable energy ({VRE}) resources increasingly add fluctuations to power systems. The required types and capacities of balancing measures, amounts of curtailment, and costs associated with system integration need to be assessed for advising policy makers and economic actors. Previous studies mostly exclude storage from model-endogenous capacity expansion and omit concentrated solar power ({CSP}) completely. In this study, we stress the need for grid and backup capacity by investigating an integrated market in Europe, allowing for additional short-term as well as long-term storage and considering {CSP} as a dispatchable backup option. The Renewable Energy Mix ({REMix}) energy system model is introduced and applied to assess the capacity expansion and hourly dispatch at various levels of photovoltaic and wind power penetration. The model results demonstrate combinations of spatial and temporal balancing measures that enable net photovoltaic and wind supply shares of 60\% and 70\% of the annual demand, respectively. The usage of storage and grid can keep curtailments below 20\% of the demand for theoretical {VRE} shares of up to 100\%. Furthermore, we determine that the {VRE} supply structure has a strong impact on the least-cost allocation of power plants across Europe but only a limited effect on supply costs.},

	abstract = {The United Nations-led international climate change negotiations in Paris in December 2015 ({COP}21) trigger and enhance climate action across the globe. This paper presents a model-based assessment of the Paris Agreement. In particular, we assess the mitigation policies implied by the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions ({INDCs}) put forward in the run-up to {COP}21 by individual member states and a policy that is likely to limit global warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. We combine a technology-rich bottom-up energy system model with an economy-wide top-down {CGE} model to analyse the impact on greenhouse gas emissions, energy demand and supply, and the wider economic effects, including the implications for trade flows and employment levels. In addition, we illustrate how the gap between the Paris mitigation pledges and a pathway that is likely to restrict global warming to 2°C can be bridged. Results indicate that energy demand reduction and a decarbonisation of the power sector are important contributors to overall emission reductions up to 2050. Further, the analysis shows that the Paris pledges lead to relatively small losses in {GDP}, indicating that global action to cut emissions is consistent with robust economic growth. The results for employment indicate a potential transition of jobs from energy-intensive to low-carbon, service oriented sectors.},

We give a detailed specification of {OPERA}’s underlying methodology and approach, as well as a description of its multiple applications. The model has been used extensively to formulate strategic policy advice on energy decarbonization and climate change mitigation for the Dutch government, and to perform exploratory studies on the role of specific low-carbon energy technologies in the energy transition of the Netherlands. Based on a reference scenario established through extensive consultation with industry and the public sector, {OPERA} allows for examining the impact of autonomous technology diffusion and energy efficiency improvement processes, and investigating a broad range of policy interventions that target greenhouse gas emission abatement or air pollution reduction, amongst others. Two characteristics that render {OPERA} particularly useful are the fact that (1) it covers the entire energy system and all greenhouse gas emissions of the Netherlands, and (2) it possesses a high temporal resolution, including a module for flexibly handling individual time units. The simulation of the complete Dutch energy system and the ability to represent energy supply and demand on an hourly basis allow for making balanced judgments on how to best accommodate large amounts of variable renewable energy production. {OPERA} is therefore particularly suited for analyzing subjects in the field of system integration, which makes it an ideal tool for assessing the implementation of the energy transition and the establishment of a low-carbon economy. We outline several near-term developments and opportunities for future improvements and refinements of {OPERA}. One of {OPERA}’s attractive features is that its structure can readily be applied to other countries, notably in Europe, and could thus relatively easily be extended to cover the entire European Union.},

	abstract = {In future electricity systems, not only electricity generation but also frequency stabilization must be provided by low-carbon technologies. Battery systems are a promising solution to fill this gap. However, uncertainties regarding their revenue potential may hinder investments. Therefore, we apply the agent-based electricity market model {AMIRIS} to simulate a day-ahead market and an automatic frequency restoration reserves market. Demonstrating the model setup, we chose a scenario with high shares of renewable energies. First, we back-test our model with historic market data from Germany in 2019. The simulation results’ mean day-ahead prices of 39.20EUR/{MWh} are close to the historic ones of 38.70EUR/{MWh}. Second, we model both markets in a scenario for 2030. The simulated day-ahead market prices are higher on average than observed today, although, we find around 550 h/yr in which the load is fully covered by renewable energies. The variance in simulated prices is slightly higher compared to historic values. Bids on the reserve capacity market are derived from opportunity costs of not participating in the day-ahead market. This results in prices of up to 45EUR/{MW} for positive reserve while the prices for negative reserve are 0EUR/{MW}. Finally, we evaluate revenue potentials of battery storages. Compared to 2019, we see an improved economic potential and increased importance of the day-ahead market. High power battery storages perform best whereas improvements in round-trip efficiency only marginally improve revenues. Although demonstrated for Germany, the presented modular approach can be adapted to international markets enabling comprehensive battery storage assessments.},

This paper introduces an agent-based model that allows studying the impact of changing energy policy instruments on the economic performance of {RES} operators and marketers. The model structure, its components, and linkages are presented in detail; an additional case study demonstrates the capability of our sociotechnical model. We find that changes in the political framework cannot be mapped directly to {RES} operators as behaviour of intermediary market actors has to be considered as well. Characteristics and strategies of intermediaries are thus an important factor for successful {RES} marketing and further deployment.

	abstract = {A rapidly changing electricity sector requires adjusted and new ancillary services, which enable the secure and reliable operation of the electricity system. However, assessments and policy advice regarding ancillary services and market design lack methods to evaluate the complex interaction of markets and services. Therefore, this paper contributes an open-source agent-based model to test design options for ancillary services and electricity markets. The Ancillary Services Acquisition Model ({ASAM}) combines the agent-based modeling framework {MESA} with the toolbox Python for Power System Analysis ({PyPSA}). The model provides various design parameters per market and agent-specific strategies as well as detailed clearing algorithms for the day-ahead market, intra-day continuous trading, redispatch, and imbalances. Moreover, {ASAM} includes numerous policy performance indicators, including a novel price mark-up indicator and novel redispatch performance indicators. A stylized simulation scenario verified and validated the model and addressed a redispatch design question. The results displayed the following implications from order types in redispatch markets with multi-period all-or-none design: (1) The order design provides few risks for market parties, as orders are fully cleared. (2) Large orders may lead to dispatch ramps before and after the delivery period and may cause “ramp-risk” mark-ups as well as additional trading of imbalances on intra-day. (3) All-or-none design in a liquid situation leads to the over-procurement of redispatch by the grid operator, as orders cannot be partially activated. Moreover, it is likely that the grid operator induces imbalances to the system by “incomplete” redispatch activation (i.e. upward and downward redispatch volumes are not equal).},

	abstract = {Averting the impending harms of climate change requires to replace fossil fuels with renewables as a primary source of energy. Non-electric renewable potential being limited, this implies extending the use of electricity generated from wind and solar beyond the power sector, either by direct electrification or synthetic fuels. Modeling the transformation towards such an energy system is challenging, because it imposes to consider fluctuations of wind and solar and the manifold ways the demand side could adjust to these fluctuations. This paper introduces a graph-based method to formulate energy system models to address these challenges. By organizing sets in rooted trees, two features to facilitate modeling high shares of renewables and sector integration are enabled. First, the method allows the level of temporal and spatial detail to be varied by energy carrier. This enables modeling with a high level of detail and a large scope, while keeping models computationally tractable. Second, the degree to which energy carriers are substitutable when converted, stored, transported, or consumed can be modeled to achieve a detailed but flexible representation of sector integration. An application of the formulation demonstrates that the variation of temporal detail achieves an average reduction in computation time of 70{\textbackslash}\%.},

Applying this methodology to Great Britain for 2050, we find that {VRE}-focused power system design is highly sensitive to the inter-annual variability of weather and that planning based on a single year can lead to operational inadequacy and failure to meet long-term decarbonization objectives. However, some insights do emerge that are relatively stable to weather-year. Reinforcement of the transmission system consistently leads to a decrease in system costs while electricity storage and flexible generation, needed to integrate {VRE} into the system, are generally deployed close to demand centres.},

	abstract = {The advancing energy transition is leading to a constantly increasing number of prosumers and active participants in the energy system. Local energy markets are considered a promising approach to coordinate those active participants efficiently, increase acceptance among the population, and decrease grid expansion costs. However, energy models and markets do not consider heterogeneous user preferences which are considered crucial for the progressing energy transition. Therefore, this paper proposes new auction-based local energy market models that consider user preferences and users’ willingness to pay a premium for heterogeneous energy qualities. In order to account for the unknown and stochastic user behavior in such a new market setting, we simulate and compare existing and newly developed auction-based clearing algorithms with an unbiased Monte Carlo method and evaluate whether they fulfill pre-defined key characteristics. Based on the results, we conclude and identify a clearing algorithm that verifiably satisfies user preferences, considers willingness to pay a premium, increases local coverage of electricity, maintains individual rationality, and computational tractability. The presented clearing algorithms enable new market designs that can help to increase acceptance and accelerate the expansion of renewable energies. All market models and simulations are publicly available in the open-source repository lemlab. Future research will validate the presented results in a field trial in Germany with 20 households.},

	abstract = {Co-simulation is commonly used for the analysis of complex cyber-physical energy systems ({CPES}). Different domain-specific simulation tools and modeling approaches are used to simulate all or parts of the system. The co-simulation framework mosaik is a powerful tool to couple these simulation tools and models. This paper identifies the limitations of mosaik 2 for simulating systems that combine continuous and discrete behavior, and introduces the new version mosaik 3.0 with improved event capabilities to efficiently combine time-stepped and discrete event simulation. Here it is explained how these extensions and new features of mosaik can be applied and implemented for extended co-simulation scenarios.},

It follows the need for multi-domain models and appropriate tools for the design and evaluation of new concepts and ideas related to the upcoming Smart Grid. As an adequate approach, {MOCES} is capable of modeling physical systems as well as the mainly event-driven behavior of interacting entities and feedback loops across the domains. In addition, it covers timescales from seconds to days. Contrary to other approaches following an agent or co-simulation concept, {MOCES} is monolithic, based on the modeling language Modelica. To meet the requirements imposed on a simulation tool, we use the possibility to enhance Modelica within its language specification. The basic idea of {MOCES} is to extend the physical model of each entity by a connected representative in a parallel simulation. To show the feasibility of the concept, a simulation example investigates the benefits and drawbacks of local energy markets.},

The geographical coverage of the model comprises Germany, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxemburg, Great Britain and Ireland. The model simulates the electricity market operation for the entire region at half hourly resolution and produces results in terms of electricity prices, cross border flows, emissions and associated total system costs. The impact of two carbon prices is examined within the model. Results highlight the policy challenges that arise when individual Member States formulate renewable energy plans in isolation in the absence of integrated modelling of interconnected regions as cross border power flows play a more significant role in market dynamics especially in the presence of geographically dispersed variable renewable generation sources such as wind and solar. From a policy perspective results suggest that based on these national plans, congestion will be present on a number of key lines at long periods during the year.},

It provides power flow, optimal power flow, state estimation, topological graph searches and short circuit calculations according to {IEC} 60909. pandapower includes a Newton-Raphson power flow solver formerly based on {PYPOWER}, which has been accelerated with just-in-time compilation. Additional enhancements to the solver include the capability to model constant current loads, grids with multiple reference nodes and a connectivity check. The pandapower network model is based on electric elements, such as lines, two and three-winding transformers or ideal switches. All elements can be defined with nameplate parameters and are internally processed with equivalent circuit models, which have been validated against industry standard software tools. The tabular data structure used to define networks is based on the Python library pandas, which allows comfortable handling of input and output parameters. The implementation in Python makes pandapower easy to use and allows comfortable extension with third-party libraries. pandapower has been successfully applied in several grid studies as well as for educational purposes. A comprehensive, publicly available case-study demonstrates a possible application of pandapower in an automated time series calculation.},

The main component of the modular and flexible software-tool is an abstract approach to the energy storage model, which allows the variation of different storage technologies and technical sub-components. Furthermore, stress characterization enables the estimation of the energy storage device's degradation. Various aging models can be used for this purpose, whereby detailed models based on aging experiments especially for batteries are currently developed at the {EES} Institute. In order to optimize the utilization of the energy storage in the different applications, a large number of operating strategies are implemented. Time series simulations allow for technical evaluations and calculation of relevant key figures.

We compare key characteristics of the different models, provide an overview of model applications, and summarize key findings on power storage requirements. We also evaluate which system values of storage are covered by respective model analyses. Based on the literature survey, we identify common findings and key model features required for a sound assessment of future storage requirements. In order to raise complementary insights, we introduce {DIETER}, a new dispatch and investment model. The model contributes to the literature by capturing multiple system values of power storage related to arbitrage, capacity, and reserve provision. Further, the model is designed as an open-source tool that can be freely used and modified. Results of a first application of the new model are presented in a companion paper.},

The mixed-integer linear program minimises total system cost while complying with operational constraints, carbon emission targets, and ancillary service requirements. A data clustering technique and the relaxation of integer scheduling constraints is evaluated and applied to decrease the model solution time. Two cost learning curves for the different power technologies are derived: one assuming local learning effects, the other accounting for global knowledge spill-over. A piece-wise linear formulation allows the integration of the exponential learning curves into the {ESO}-{XEL} model. The model is applied to the {UK} power system in the time frame of 2015 to 2050. The consideration of cost learning effects moves optimal investment timings to earlier planning years and influences the competitiveness of technologies. In addition, the maximum capacity build rate parameter influences the share of power generation significantly; the possibility of rapid capacity build-up is more important for total system cost reduction by 2050 than accounting for technology cost reduction.},

We study the effects of {CO}2 price floors and a price ceiling on the dynamic investment pathway of two interlinked electricity markets (loosely based on Great Britain, which already has introduced a price floor, and on Central Western Europe). Using an agent-based electricity market simulation with endogenous investment and a {CO}2 market (including banking), we analyse the cross-border effects of national policies as well as system-wide policy options. A common, moderate {CO}2 auction reserve price results in a more continuous decarbonisation pathway. This reduces {CO}2 price volatility and the occurrence of carbon shortage price periods, as well as the average cost to consumers. A price ceiling can shield consumers from extreme price shocks. These price restrictions do not cause a large risk of an overall emissions overshoot in the long run. A national price floor lowers the cost to consumers in the other zone; the larger the zone with the price floor, the stronger the effect. Price floors that are too high lead to inefficiencies in investment choices and to higher consumer costs.},

This paper describes the open-source {MEDEAS} modeling framework, which has been developed with the aim of informing decision-making to achieve the transition to sustainable energy systems with a focus on biophysical, economic, social and technological restrictions and tackling some of the limitations identified in the current {IAMs}. {MEDEAS} models include the following relevant characteristics: representation of biophysical constraints to energy availability; modeling of the mineral and energy investments for the energy transition, allowing a dynamic assessment of the potential mineral scarcities and computation of the net energy available to society; consistent representation of climate change damages with climate assessments by natural scientists; integration of detailed sectoral economic structure (input–output analysis) within a system dynamics approach; energy shifts driven by physical scarcity; and a rich set of socioeconomic and environmental impact indicators. The potentialities and novel insights that this framework brings are illustrated by the simulation of four variants of current trends with the {MEDEAS}-world model: the consideration of alternative plausible assumptions and methods, combined with the feedback-rich structure of the model, reveal dynamics and implications absent in classical models. Our results suggest that the continuation of current trends will drive significant biophysical scarcities and impacts which will most likely derive in regionalization (priority to security concerns and trade barriers), conflict, and ultimately, a severe global crisis which may lead to the collapse of our modern civilization. Despite depicting a much more worrying future than conventional projections of current trends, we however believe it is a more realistic counterfactual scenario that will allow the design of improved alternative sustainable pathways in future work.},

The rapid expansion of {RES} requires a structural rearrangement of the entire power system to ensure the current level of supply security. Scientific approaches to the characterization and improvement of power transmission networks, however, often lack the availability of reliable and appropriate data on the networks’ structure. Using {SciGRID}, which was recently released open source, we generate a topological grid model for Germany using open data provided by {OpenStreetMap}. Starting from this particular grid model we characterize the structure of the German transmission grid by means of graph-theoretical decomposition approaches to complexity reduction. Our procedure aims to identify key features and characteristics complementing the grid’s electrotechnical properties; it is for example used to characterize the {SciGRID} approach and validate the resulting models against other (potentially not open source) transmission network models. In addition, it paves the way for networks with reduced complexity, which might be beneficial in optimization problems addressing system design and operation.},
