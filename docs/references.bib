Numerous texts are available to guide researchers in conducting robust survey research online, however this is neither a quick nor easy undertaking. While online survey websites and software are useful for assisting in questionnaire design and delivery, they can also introduce sources of bias. Researchers considering conducting online surveys are encouraged to read carefully about how the principles of survey research can be applied to online formats in order to reduce bias and enhance rigor. In addition to alerting researchers to the pitfalls of online surveys this article also aims to equip readers of this journal with the knowledge of how to critically appraise publications based on online surveys.},

In this paper, we recognize a few recent efforts and discuss a number of viable directions for developing a potential {EMO} algorithm for solving many-objective optimization problems. Thereafter, we suggest a reference-point-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm following {NSGA}-{II} framework (we call it {NSGA}-{III}) that emphasizes population members that are nondominated, yet close to a set of supplied reference points. The proposed {NSGA}-{III} is applied to a number of many-objective test problems with three to 15 objectives and compared with two versions of a recently suggested {EMO} algorithm ({MOEA}/D). While each of the two {MOEA}/D methods works well on different classes of problems, the proposed {NSGA}-{III} is found to produce satisfactory results on all problems considered in this paper. This paper presents results on unconstrained problems, and the sequel paper considers constrained and other specialties in handling many-objective optimization problems.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose the use of modified distance calculation in generational distance ({GD}) and inverted generational distance ({IGD}). These performance indicators evaluate the quality of an obtained solution set in comparison with a pre-specified reference point set. Both indicators are based on the distance between a solution and a reference point. The Euclidean distance in an objective space is usually used for distance calculation. Our idea is to take into account the dominance relation between a solution and a reference point when we calculate their distance. If a solution is dominated by a reference point, the Euclidean distance is used for their distance calculation with no modification. However, if they are non-dominated with each other, we calculate the minimum distance from the reference point to the dominated region by the solution. This distance can be viewed as an amount of the inferiority of the solution (i.e., the insufficiency of its objective values) in comparison with the reference point. We demonstrate using simple examples that some Pareto non-compliant results of {GD} and {IGD} are resolved by the modified distance calculation. We also show that {IGD} with the modified distance calculation is weakly Pareto compliant whereas the original {IGD} is Pareto non-compliant.},

nuclear power projected to grow in countries with increasing electricity demand, corresponding
jobs in the nuclear power sector will also grow Using the most available macro-economic
model to determine total employment - the 'input/output' model - the Nuclear
Energy Agency and International Atomic Energy Agency collaborated to measure direct,
indirect and induced employment from the nuclear power sector in a national economy
The results indicate that direct employment during site preparation and construction
of a single unit 1 000 megawatt-electric advanced light water reactor at any point
in time for 10 years is approximately 1200 professional and construction staff, or
about 12000 labour years For 50 years of operation, approximately 600 administrative,
operation and maintenance, and permanently contracted staff are employed annually,
or about 30 000 labour years For up to 10 years of decommissioning, about 500 people
are employed annually, or around 5000 labour years Finally, over an approximate period
of 40 years, close to 80 employees are managing nuclear waste, totaling around 3000
labour years A total of about 50000 direct labour-years per gigawatt Direct expenditures
on these employees and equipment generate approximately the same number of indirect
employment, or about 50000 labour years; and direct and indirect expenditures generate
about the same number of induced employment, or 100000 labour years Total employment
in the nuclear power sector of a given national economy is therefore roughly 200000

Often, the time scales of the interactions are unknown to an external observer and need to be inferred from time series of observed data. We explore, in this work, the properties of several ordinal-based quantiÔ¨Åers for the identiÔ¨Åcation of time-delays from time series. To that end, we generate artiÔ¨Åcial time series of stochastic and deterministic time-delay models. We Ô¨Ånd that the presence of a nonlinearity in the generating model has consequences for the distribution of ordinal patterns and, consequently, on the delay-identiÔ¨Åcation qualities of the quantiÔ¨Åers. Here, we put forward a novel ordinal-based quantiÔ¨Åer that is particularly sensitive to nonlinearities in the generating model and compare it with previously-deÔ¨Åned quantiÔ¨Åers. We conclude from our analysis on artiÔ¨Åcially generated data that the proper identiÔ¨Åcation of the presence of a time-delay and its precise value from time series beneÔ¨Åts from the complementary use of ordinal-based quantiÔ¨Åers and the standard autocorrelation function. We further validate these tools with a practical example on real-world data originating from the North Atlantic Oscillation weather phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis (Temoa) is an open source modeling framework for conducting energy system analysis. The core component of Temoa is an energy system optimization model. Such models have emerged as critical tools for technology assessment and policy analysis at scales ranging from local to global. Energy system models enable a simultaneously broad and deep assessment of technology by considering the economic and technical characteristics of individual technologies as well as their interactions within a well-defined system. The energy system is described algebraically as a network of linked processes that convert a raw energy commodity (e.g., coal, oil, biomass, uranium) into an end-use demand (e.g., lighting, transport, water heating, conditioned air), often through a series of one or more intermediate commodities (e.g., electricity, gasoline, ethanol). Each technology is defined by a set of engineering, economic, and environmental characteristics (e.g., capital cost, efficiency, emissions rate) associated with converting an energy commodity from one form to another. Technologies are linked to one another in a network via model constraints representing the allowable flow of energy commodities. The model objective is to minimize the present cost of energy supply by deploying and utilizing energy technologies and commodities over time to meet a set of end-use demands. Temoa is formulated as a linear programming problem and is implemented in Python using Pyomo, a Python-based open source software package. The design of Temoa is intended to fulfill a unique niche within the energy modeling community by addressing two critical shortcomings: an inability to conduct third party verification of published model-based results and the difficulty of conducting rigorous uncertainty analysis with large, complex models. Temoa leverages a modern revision control system to publicly archive model source and data, which enables third party verification of all published modeling work. In addition, Temoa represents the first energy system optimization model to be designed ‚Äì from its initial conceptualization ‚Äì for operation within a high performance computing environment.},

One of the difficulties faced is the imbalance between the competing aims of economics, politics and the environment which form the trilemma of energy policy. This article advances that this energy trilemma can be resolved through energy justice. Energy justice develops the debate on energy policy to one that highlights cosmopolitanism, progresses thinking beyond economics and incorporates a new futuristic perspective. To capture these dynamics of energy justice, this research developed an Energy Justice Metric ({EJM}) that involves the calculation of several metrics: (1) a country (national) {EJM}; (2) an {EJM} for different energy infrastructure; and (3) an {EJM} which is incorporated into economic models that derive costs for energy infrastructure projects. An {EJM} is modeled for China, the European Union and the United States, and for different energy infrastructure in the United Kingdom. The {EJM} is plotted on a Ternary Phase Diagram which is used in the sciences for analyzing the relationship (trilemma) of three forms of matter. The development of an {EJM} can provide a tool for decision-making on energy policy and one that solves the energy trilemma with a just and equitable approach.},

Deploying {DACCS} significantly reduces mitigation costs, and it complements rather than substitutes other {NETs}. The key factor limiting {DACCS} deployment is the rate at which it can be scaled up. Our scenarios‚Äô average {DACCS} scale-up rates of 1.5‚Äâ{GtCO}2/yr would require considerable sorbent production and up to 300‚Äâ{EJ}/yr of energy input by 2100. The risk of assuming that {DACCS} can be deployed at scale, and finding it to be subsequently unavailable, leads to a global temperature overshoot of up to 0.8‚Äâ¬∞C. {DACCS} should therefore be developed and deployed alongside, rather than instead of, other mitigation options.},

	abstract = {{CO}2 direct air capture ({DAC}) has been increasingly discussed as a climate change mitigation option. Despite technical advances in the past decade, there are still misconceptions about {DAC}'s current and long-term costs as well as energy, water and area demands. This could undermine {DAC}'s anticipated role in a neutral or negative greenhouse gas emission energy system, and influence policy makers. In this study, a literature review and techno-economic analyses of state-of-the-art {DAC} technologies are performed, wherein, {DAC} technologies are categorised as high temperature aqueous solutions ({HT} {DAC}) and low temperature solid sorbent ({LT} {DAC}) systems, from an energy system perspective. {DAC} capital expenditures, energy demands and costs have been estimated under two scenarios for {DAC} capacities and financial learning rates in the period 2020 to 2050. {DAC} system costs could be lowered significantly with commercialisation in the 2020s followed by massive implementation in the 2040s and 2050s, making them cost competitive with point source carbon capture and an affordable climate change mitigation solution. It is concluded that {LT} {DAC} systems are favourable due to lower heat supply costs and the possibility of using waste heat from other systems. {CO}2 capture costs of {LT} {DAC} systems powered by hybrid {PV}-Wind-battery systems for Moroccan conditions and based on a conservative scenario, without/with utilisation of free waste heat are calculated at 222/133, 105/60, 69/40 and 54/32 ‚Ç¨/{tCO}2 in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050, respectively.

The energy demands for low-temperature solid-sorbent {DAC} are mainly heat at around 100¬†¬∞C and electricity, which lead to sustainably operated {DAC} systems based on low-cost renewable electricity and heat pumps for the heat supply. This analysis is carried out for the case of the Maghreb region, which enjoys abundantly available low-cost renewable energy resources. The energy transition results for the Maghreb region lead to a solar photovoltaic ({PV})-dominated energy supply with some wind energy contribution. {DAC} systems will need the same energy supply structure. The research investigates the levelised cost of {CO}2 {DAC} ({LCOD}) in high spatial resolution and is based on full hourly modelling for the Maghreb region. The key results are {LCOD} of about 55¬†‚Ç¨/{tCO}2 in 2050 with a further cost reduction potential of up to 50\%. The area demand is considered and concluded to be negligible. Major conclusions for {CO}2 removal as a new energy sector are drawn.

To date, the surface area required for {RE} systems is greater than that for non-{RE} systems, exacerbating existing environmental policy challenges, from increasing land competition, to visual impacts. A suitable metric for comparing the extent of systems is the power density of electricity production, that is, the electrical power produced per horizontal m2 of surface area. This study systematically reviews power densities for 9 energy-types (wind, solar etc.) and multiple sub-types (e.g., for solar power: {PV}, solar thermal) in the United States. Median, mean, and uncertainty estimates are provided for 177 different densities from the literature. Non-renewable power densities are found to be three orders of magnitude larger than renewable densities. Natural gas and solar energy yield the highest median density per non-{RE}, and {RE} system respectively. Solar energy was the only system to experience a significant, positive relationship in power density over time. We apply these density estimates to {NREL} scenarios of future energy systems for state-specific assessments, and find that the largest growth in land use is in the southern United States.},

This paper presents the ranges of realistic potential supply for solar and wind electricity, using a 1km2 grid level analysis covering the whole world at country level. In addition, the potential for building-based solar electricity is assessed. We find that long-term combined potentials range between 730 and 3700EJ/a worldwide, depending crucially on the acceptable share of land‚Äîup to 3.5\% of total (non-ice covered) land on earth. Realistic potentials account for limitations such as land-use competition and acceptance, together with resource quality and remoteness as proxies for cost. Today's electricity demand (65EJ/a) is well covered by the range, but constraints may occur in the long run locally. Amongst large countries, Nigeria and India may need imports to meet electricity demand.},

	abstract = {Photovoltaic ({PV}) module costs have declined rapidly over forty years but the reasons remain elusive. Here we advance a conceptual framework and quantitative method for quantifying the causes of cost changes in a technology, and apply it to {PV} modules. Our method begins with a cost model that breaks down cost into variables that changed over time. Cost change equations are then derived to quantify each variable's contribution. We distinguish between changes observed in variables of the cost model ‚Äì which we term low-level mechanisms of cost reduction ‚Äì and research and development, learning-by-doing, and scale economies, which we refer to as high-level mechanisms. We find that increased module efficiency was the leading low-level cause of cost reduction in 1980‚Äì2012, contributing almost 25\% of the decline. Government-funded and private R\&D was the most important high-level mechanism over this period. After 2001, however, scale economies became a more significant cause of cost reduction, approaching R\&D in importance. Policies that stimulate market growth have played a key role in enabling {PV}'s cost reduction, through privately-funded R\&D and scale economies, and to a lesser extent learning-by-doing. The method presented here can be adapted to retrospectively or prospectively study many technologies, and performance metrics besides cost.},

	abstract = {Effects of climate warming on natural and human systems are becoming increasingly visible across the globe. For example, the shattering of past yearly records for global high temperatures seems to be a near-annual event, with the five hottest years since 1880 all occurring since 2005 (1). Not coincidentally, the single hottest year on record, 2015, also broke records for area burned by wildfire in the United States (Fig. 1 A and B ), eclipsing the previous high mark set just one decade prior (2). Scientists have known for some time that climate is a key driver of forest fires; records from the past and present (3‚áì‚Äì5) provide strong evidence that warmer temperatures are associated with spikes in fire activity. Therefore, recent increases in wildfire activity as the planet warms are not a surprise. However, just how much of the recent increases in forest fire activity can be attributed to human-caused climate change vs. natural variability in climate? This question has profound scientific, management, and policy implications, yet answers have thus far remained elusive. In {PNAS}, Abatzoglou and Williams (6) present strong evidence that human-caused climate change is increasing wildfire activity across wide swaths of forested land in the western United States. They demonstrate that human-caused climate change has lengthened the annual fire season (i.e., the window of time each year with weather that is conducive to forest fires) and, since 1984, has doubled the cumulative area in the western United States that would have otherwise burned due to natural climate forcing alone. ‚Ä¶

We show experimentally that information specifically addressing these key concerns can substantially increase the support for climate policies in many countries. Explaining how policies work and who can benefit from them is critical to foster policy support, whereas simply informing people about the impacts of climate change is not effective. Furthermore, we identify several socioeconomic and lifestyle factors ‚Äì most notably education, political leanings, and availability of public transportation ‚Äì that are significantly correlated with both policy views and overall reasoning and beliefs about climate policies.

	abstract = {An effective response to climate change demands rapid replacement of fossil carbon energy sources. This must occur concurrently with an ongoing rise in total global energy consumption. While many modelled scenarios have been published claiming to show that a 100\% renewable electricity system is achievable, there is no empirical or historical evidence that demonstrates that such systems are in fact feasible. Of the studies published to date, 24 have forecast regional, national or global energy requirements at sufficient detail to be considered potentially credible. We critically review these studies using four novel feasibility criteria for reliable electricity systems needed to meet electricity demand this century. These criteria are: (1) consistency with mainstream energy-demand forecasts; (2) simulating supply to meet demand reliably at hourly, half-hourly, and five-minute timescales, with resilience to extreme climate events; (3) identifying necessary transmission and distribution requirements; and (4) maintaining the provision of essential ancillary services. Evaluated against these objective criteria, none of the 24 studies provides convincing evidence that these basic feasibility criteria can be met. Of a maximum possible unweighted feasibility score of seven, the highest score for any one study was four. Eight of 24 scenarios (33\%) provided no form of system simulation. Twelve (50\%) relied on unrealistic forecasts of energy demand. While four studies (17\%; all regional) articulated transmission requirements, only two scenarios‚Äîdrawn from the same study‚Äîaddressed ancillary-service requirements. In addition to feasibility issues, the heavy reliance on exploitation of hydroelectricity and biomass raises concerns regarding environmental sustainability and social justice. Strong empirical evidence of feasibility must be demonstrated for any study that attempts to construct or model a low-carbon energy future based on any combination of low-carbon technology. On the basis of this review, efforts to date seem to have substantially underestimated the challenge and delayed the identification and implementation of effective and comprehensive decarbonization pathways.},

In the {US}, the state‚Äôs central move was to present itself as a responsible regulator of a potentially runaway technology that demands effective ‚Äúcontainment.‚Äù In South Korea, the dominant imaginary was of ‚Äúatoms for development‚Äù which the state not only imported but incorporated into its scientific, technological and political practices.

The article argues that the current conceptualizations of energy justice cannot be separated from the politics of incumbency as, without a decolonial critique, they tend to reproduce rather than transform hegemonic power relations. To be transformative, energy justice must be articulated from the politics of actually existing unsustainability. In other words, the starting position for energy justice must be that energy injustices are already embedded in existing energy systems and energy policies. Drawing on Latin-American decolonial thought, and the work of political ecologists around energy, this article advocates looking beyond a universalized conception of justice towards an approach where justice is based on a sense of place and is informed by the community?s relationship with the land. Using the concept of energy landscapes, the article puts forth an alternative way of understanding energy systems and conceptualizations of justice in decolonial settings.},

In studying such controversies, researchers have a tendency to focus on opponents, the public and local communities. There have been calls for some years now to broaden the scope of social science to include renewable energy technology ({RET}) actors such as project developers, governments or other actors involved in supporting or implementing renewable energy developments. Attention for {RET} actors is still limited and it is unclear where this area of research currently stands. Therefore, we present a systematic review of literature about {RET} actors in relation to controversies surrounding renewable energy technologies and infrastructure. The review of 89 publications shows two categories, consisting of eleven themes in total. The first category concerns {RET} actors' perceptions of the nature, impact and causes of public opposition, including specific groups of people and processes of engagement and decision-making. The second category describes different responses and strategies of {RET} actors to public opposition. Based on these findings, we present three observations about the current state of knowledge on {RET} actors and discuss implications for the broader field of renewable energy controversies. Future research should be directed at unravelling the diverse range of {RET} actors and their practices. This contributes to constructing a finer-grained understanding of the (development of) conflict dynamics between the actors engaged in controversies and action perspectives for the involved actors.},

Beyond greenhouse gas emissions, the power sector is also responsible for numerous other environmental impacts. Here we combine scenarios from integrated assessment models with a¬†forward-looking life-cycle assessment to explore how alternative technology choices in power sector decarbonization pathways compare in terms of non-climate environmental impacts at the system level. While all decarbonization pathways yield major environmental co-benefits, we find that the scale of co-benefits as well as profiles of adverse side-effects depend strongly on technology choice. Mitigation scenarios focusing on wind and solar power are more effective in reducing human health impacts compared to those with low renewable energy, while inducing a more pronounced shift away from fossil and toward mineral resource depletion. Conversely, non-climate ecosystem damages are highly uncertain but tend to increase, chiefly due to land requirements for bioenergy.},

In this paper, we identify, characterize, and evaluate concerns over the use of vulnerability approaches in the climate change field based on a review of peer-reviewed articles published since 1990 (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ587). Seven concerns are identified: neglect of social drivers, promotion of a static understanding of human-environment interactions, vagueness about the concept of vulnerability, neglect of cross-scale interactions, passive and negative framing, limited influence on decision-making, and limited collaboration across disciplines. Examining each concern against trends in the literature, we find some of these concerns weakly justified, but others pose valid challenges to vulnerability research. Efforts to revitalize vulnerability research are needed, with priority areas including developing the next generation of empirical studies, catalyzing collaboration across disciplines to leverage and build on the strengths of divergent intellectual traditions involved in vulnerability research, and linking research to the practical realities of decision-making.},

	abstract = {The United Nations-led international climate change negotiations in Paris in December 2015 ({COP}21) trigger and enhance climate action across the globe. This paper presents a model-based assessment of the Paris Agreement. In particular, we assess the mitigation policies implied by the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions ({INDCs}) put forward in the run-up to {COP}21 by individual member states and a policy that is likely to limit global warming to 2¬∞C above pre-industrial levels. We combine a technology-rich bottom-up energy system model with an economy-wide top-down {CGE} model to analyse the impact on greenhouse gas emissions, energy demand and supply, and the wider economic effects, including the implications for trade flows and employment levels. In addition, we illustrate how the gap between the Paris mitigation pledges and a pathway that is likely to restrict global warming to 2¬∞C can be bridged. Results indicate that energy demand reduction and a decarbonisation of the power sector are important contributors to overall emission reductions up to 2050. Further, the analysis shows that the Paris pledges lead to relatively small losses in {GDP}, indicating that global action to cut emissions is consistent with robust economic growth. The results for employment indicate a potential transition of jobs from energy-intensive to low-carbon, service oriented sectors.},

Thus, with {EnergyPLAN}, the user can take a holistic approach focusing on the analysis of the cross-sectoral interaction. Traditionally disparate demand sectors, such as buildings, industry and transport, are linked with supply technologies through electricity, gas, district heating and cooling grids. In this way, {EnergyPLAN} enables the analysis of the conversion of renewable electricity into other energy carriers, such as heat, hydrogen, green gases and electrofuels, as well as the implementation of energy efficiency improvements and energy conservation. This article describes the overall structure of {EnergyPLAN} and the essential algorithms and computational structure.},

model (Fishbone et al, 1983) and the many notes and partial documents which have been

Part I deals with the Standard {MARKAL} model, an intertemporal partial equilibrium
model based on competitive, far sighted energy markets.
Part {II} discusses {MARKAL}-{MACRO}, a General Equilibrium model obtained by merging
{MARKAL} with a set of macroeconomic equations.
Part {III} describes the {SAGE} model, a time-stepped version of {MARKAL} where a static
partial equilibrium is computed for each time period separately.
Each Part is further divided in two main chapters, the first describing the properties of the
model, its mathematical properties, and its economic rationale, and the second
constituting a reference guide containing a full description of the parameters, variables,
and equations of the model.
Note that section 2.11 in Part I deals with the {GAMS} environment and control sequences
for running the models. It appplies to all three parts of the documentation.
Although the three parts are presented as separate files with their own tables of contents,
the numbering of chapters, sections, and pages is continuous across all thtree parts.},

The required types and capacities of balancing measures, amounts of curtailment, and costs associated with system integration need to be assessed for advising policy makers and economic actors. Previous studies mostly exclude storage from model-endogenous capacity expansion and omit concentrated solar power ({CSP}) completely. In this study, we stress the need for grid and backup capacity by investigating an integrated market in Europe, allowing for additional short-term as well as long-term storage and considering {CSP} as a dispatchable backup option. The Renewable Energy Mix ({REMix}) energy system model is introduced and applied to assess the capacity expansion and hourly dispatch at various levels of photovoltaic and wind power penetration. The model results demonstrate combinations of spatial and temporal balancing measures that enable net photovoltaic and wind supply shares of 60\% and 70\% of the annual demand, respectively. The usage of storage and grid can keep curtailments below 20\% of the demand for theoretical {VRE} shares of up to 100\%. Furthermore, we determine that the {VRE} supply structure has a strong impact on the least-cost allocation of power plants across Europe but only a limited effect on supply costs.},

However, sustainable systems with high shares of renewable energy are characterized by growing cross-sectoral interdependencies and decentralized structures. To capture important properties of increasingly complex energy systems, sophisticated and flexible modelling tools are needed. At the same time, open science is becoming increasingly important in energy system modelling. This paper presents the Open Energy Modelling Framework (oemof) as a novel approach to energy system modelling, representation and analysis. The framework provides a toolbox to construct comprehensive energy system models and has been published open source under a free licence. Through collaborative development based on open processes, the framework supports a maximum level of participation, transparency and open science principles in energy system modelling. Based on a generic graph-based description of energy systems, it is well-suited to flexibly model complex cross-sectoral systems and incorporate various modelling approaches. This makes the framework a multi-purpose modelling environment for modelling and analyzing different systems at scales ranging from urban to transnational.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a detailed mixed-integer linear optimization model for capacity-expansion planning and unit commitment of a factory's distributed energy supply system. The model identifies the cost-optimal configurations of specified energy-conversion processes and storage techniques to cover the factory's energy demand. The general formulation of the model allows it to deal with a large number of energy-system structures. The main constraint of the model is that it must cover given demand time series for different commodities such as electricity, heating and cooling. For each commodity, storage units with different technical and economic parameters as well as a possible external connection considering time-sensitive prices for import/export and peak demand charges can be defined. The model allows the users to specify processes, for converting between the different types of commodities. The conversion processes can handle multiple inputs and outputs and consider part-load performance as well as start-up behavior. The objective of the model is to find the optimal design and operation of the industrial energy system with minimal investment and operational costs. A case study based on the measured electric- and heat-demand time series of four different factories is presented, investigating the economic efficiency of combined heat and power ({CHP}) units and battery storage systems. The results show, that the decision as to whether {CHP} units are used, mainly depends on the relationship between gas and electricity costs, while the load profile of the factories and the applied pricing program only influence their size. Batteries are only considered in the results when their investment costs are reduced and they have little influence on the total cost.},

	abstract = {This paper compares various flexibility options to support renewable energy integration across the energy transition using energy system modelling. We analyse new flexibility assets such as electricity storage, heat pumps, demand-side response with existing wet appliances, electric boilers for domestic hot water and distribution grid expansion, along with energy efficiency measures in electrical appliances and building retrofitting. We propose an open-source sector coupling model ({GRIMSEL}-{FLEX}) to minimise, from a social planner perspective, the total cost of the energy system for electricity and residential heating supply in Switzerland, including various types of consumers and urban settings. We find relevant feedback mechanisms among various flexibility options. Firstly, electric boilers have a larger flexibility potential than demand-side response with wet appliances since they reduce storage investments by more than 26\% by 2050 (only 12\% for demand-side response). Secondly, 34\% more electricity storage is needed if heat pumps replace all fossil-based heating and 80\% to replace all heating systems entirely. Thirdly, we find a shift in the operation of heat pumps, electric boilers and wet appliances from night to midday, resulting in larger photovoltaic deployment (22\%‚Äì66\% for the residential sector). Finally, electricity storage capacity induced by heat pump deployment is highly dependent on the retrofitting rate. With 1\% per annum, 86\% of storage investments can be avoided and it can be counterbalanced with a high retrofitting rate of 2\% per annum.},

Assessing energy justice in contexts with high cultural and ecological diversity as well as high levels of marginalisation, and a post-colonial history (of domination and resistance to it), requires taking into account the local contextual understandings of justice. Current literature, however, has been mostly developed under the evidence and concepts of Global North contexts, which tend to build in universal ideas of justice, often inappropriate for policy application in the Global South. To contribute to closing this gap, the paper qualitatively analyses the implementation of a large-scale photovoltaic project in Yucatan, Mexico, examining how neighbouring indigenous communities and other key actors perceive, experience and react to procedural and socio-environmental justice issues in the project's implementation. Results show that commonly-used concepts such as consent, participation and inclusion -as currently applied in the siting of renewable infrastructure- are now mostly perceived as legitimation of projects that align with the developer and governmental priorities. Emphasising self-determination over and above the aforementioned concepts is seen as a priority among affected communities for achieving a more socially just energy transition.},

The {VOLL} depends on multiple factors such as type of customer, regional economic conditions and demographics, time and duration of outage, and other specific traits of power interruption. The reviewed literatures show that there are still issues which could be considered in estimation of the {VOLL}, especially for industrial customers. One of the most interesting issues is inclusion of reliability of an industrial plant in estimation of the {VOLL}. This means that how reliability data of the plant components (failure rates, repair time, etc.) can be incorporated in the studies to provide a probabilistic model for the {VOLL} and its related quantities. This paper incorporates failure probability in the {VOLL} estimation of an industrial plant. For this purpose, firstly an estimate for failure rate of the plant components is obtained and secondly, this estimate is applied in failure probability function which is to be incorporated in the {VOLL}.

This paper critically examines the Value of Lost Load ({VoLL}) literature and provides a framework to describe the complexity of measuring the costs of power outages. The {VoLL} metric, which is too often presented as a singular point estimate, influences electric reliability decision-making. This paper improves on prior work by clearly distinguishing applications of the {VoLL} metric between (1) cost-benefit analyses which inform centralized, reliability-enhancing infrastructure investments and (2) decentralized rationing decisions during times of electric supply shortage. Revealed preference approaches to {VoLL} estimation are introduced that offer attractive theoretical advantages over traditional estimation methods. The underlying uncertainty inherent to estimating the costs of power outages implies that cost-effectiveness analysis should remain a key tool for electric reliability decision-makers.},

Switch is capable of long-, medium- and short-term planning of investments and operations with conventional or smart grids, integrating large shares of renewable power, storage and/or demand response. Applications include integrated resource planning, investment planning, economic and policy analyses as well as basic research. Potential users include researchers, educators, industry and regulators. Switch formulates generation and transmission capacity planning as a mixed integer linear program where investment and operation are co-optimized across sampled time series during multiple investment periods. High-resolution production cost modeling is supported by freezing investment decisions and including longer time series and more operational details. Modeling features include unit commitment, part-load efficiency, planning and operating reserves, fuel supply curves, storage, hydroelectric networks, policy constraints and demand response. Switch has a modular architecture that allows users to flexibly compose models by choosing built-in modules 'a la carte' or writing custom modules. This paper describes the software architecture and model formulation of Switch 2.0 and provides a case study in which the model was used to identify the best options for obtaining load-shifting and reserve services from batteries and demand response in a 100\% renewable power system.},

However, the uncertainty about wind generation affects existing network infrastructure and power production planning of generators, which cannot be fully diminished by wind forecasts. In this paper we develop a stochastic electricity market model to analyze the impact of uncertain wind generation on the different electricity markets as well as network congestion management. Stochastic programming techniques are used to incorporate uncertain wind generation. The technical characteristics of transporting electrical energy as well as power plants are explicitly taken into account. The consecutive clearing of the electricity markets is incorporated by a rolling planning procedure reflecting the market regime of European markets. The model is applied to the German electricity system covering one week. Two different approaches of considering uncertain wind generation are analyzed and compared to a deterministic approach. The results reveal that the flexibility of generation dispatch is increased either by using more flexible generation technologies or by operating rather inflexible technologies under part-load conditions.},

To help users effectively capture the nuances of power system dynamics, {PowNet} is equipped with features that enable accuracy, transferability, and computational efficiency over large spatial and temporal domains. Specifically, the model (i) accounts for the techno-economic constraints of both generating units and transmission networks, (ii) can be easily coupled with models that estimate the status of generating units as a function of the climatic conditions, and (iii) explicitly includes import/export nodes, which are useful in representing cross-border systems. {PowNet} is implemented in Python and is compatible with any standard optimization solver (e.g., Gurobi, {CPLEX}). Its functionality is demonstrated on the Cambodian power system.

For this purpose, {POMATO} implements methods for the analysis of simultaneous zonal market clearing, nodal (N-k secure) power flow computation for capacity allocation, and multi-stage market clearing with adaptive grid representation and redispatch. The computationally demanding N-k secure power flow is enabled via an efficient constraint reduction algorithm. {POMATO} provides an integrated environment for data read-in, pre- and post-processing and interactive result visualization. Comprehensive data sets of European electricity systems compiled from Open Power System Data and Matpower Cases are part of the distribution. {POMATO} is implemented in Python and Julia, leveraging Python‚Äôs easily maintainable data processing and user interaction features and Julia‚Äôs well readable algebraic modeling language, superior computational performance and interfaces to open-source and commercial solvers.},

	abstract = {The adoption of electric vehicles is incentivized by governments around the world to decarbonize the mobility sector. Simultaneously, the continuously increasing amount of renewable energy sources and electric devices such as heat pumps and electric vehicles leads to congested grids. To meet this challenge, several forms of flexibility markets are currently being researched. So far, no analysis has calculated the actual flexibility potential of electric vehicles with different operating strategies, electricity tariffs and charging power levels while taking into account realistic user behavior. Therefore, this paper presents a detailed case study of the flexibility potential of electric vehicles for fixed and dynamic prices, for three charging power levels in consideration of Californian and German user behavior. The model developed uses vehicle and mobility data that is publicly available from field trials in the {USA} and Germany, cost-optimizes the charging process of the vehicles, and then calculates the flexibility of each electric vehicle for every 15 min. The results show that positive flexibility is mostly available during either the evening or early morning hours. Negative flexibility follows the periodic vehicle availability at home if the user chooses to charge the vehicle as late as possible. Increased charging power levels lead to increased amounts of flexibility. Future research will focus on the integration of stochastic forecasts for vehicle availability and electricity tariffs.},

Apart from the benefit of reducing {CO}2 emissions and, potentially, system cost, wind power is associated with negative impacts at the local level, such as interference with landscape aesthetics. Some of these impacts might be avoided by using alternative renewable energy technologies. Thus, we quantify the opportunity cost of wind power versus its best feasible alternative solar photovoltaics, using the power system model medea. Our findings suggest that the cost of undisturbed landscapes is considerable, particularly when solar {PV} is mainly realized on roof-tops. Under a wide range of assumptions, the opportunity cost of wind power is high enough to allow for significant compensation of the ones affected by local, negative wind turbine externalities.},

	abstract = {Planning of sustainable Urban Energy Systems is a challenging task for the many involved stakeholders which requires optimal use of available knowledge for decision support. Therefore, systematic approaches integrating energy models and interactively linking them to real-world data are highly required. In this regard, Geographic Information Systems (called {GIS}) offer as a platform many advantages and can play a significant role in integrating renewable energy sources at the urban scale. The optimal integration and placement of different possible flexibilisation technologies such as storage can profit from the possibilities offered by {GIS} tools. In addition, {GIS} facilitate policy making, allowing for a realistic and multilayer representation of urban energy systems. This contribution first draws an overview of {GIS}-based models for urban energy systems by investigating the current state of modelling. It introduces in a second step, an outline of a transferable {GIS}-based platform for the optimisation of storage and other flexibilisation technologies in urban areas. The model is composed of three main components and deals with the optimal integration of flexibilisation technologies. The fields of applications of the model are, but not restricted to, analysis of the emergence of sustainable cities, self-consumption at the urban levels, autarky measures, capacity demand and economic efficiency, and the integration of flexibility options. The method developed by the authors and presented here deals with the first component of the proposed model which is setting up the spatial framework. The framework relies mainly on spatial features of urban objects extracted from the open source {OpenStreetMap} database. The different steps involved in the spatial framework set-up are extraction and filtering of the data sets and their algorithmic steps which will be introduced here in details. A central finding of this contribution illustrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using open source data and tools to replicate urban energy features.},

	abstract = {Many studies have demonstrated the feasibility of fully renewable power systems. Yet the future costs of key technologies are highly uncertain, and little is known about the robustness of a renewable power system to these uncertainties. To analyze it, we build 315 cost scenarios by varying the costs of key technologies and we model the optimal renewable power system for France, simultaneously optimizing investment and dispatch. We add to the literature by studying a consecutive 18-years weather period; by testing all combinations of technology costs rather than changing them one-at-a-time; and by calculating the regret from optimizing the energy mix on the basis of cost assumptions that do not materialize. Our results indicate that the cost of a 100\% system is not that sensitive to uncertainty. Admittedly, the optimal energy mix is highly sensitive to cost assumptions: across our scenarios, the installed capacity in {PV}, onshore wind and power-to-gas varies by a factor of 5, batteries and offshore wind even more. However, in every scenario the total production and storage cost is similar to, or lower than the current cost. This indicates that renewable technologies will become by and large substitutable. Moreover, even if the energy mix is optimized based on cost assumptions which turn out to be wrong, the extra cost is low: 4\% in average and less than 9\% in 95\% of the scenarios.},

	abstract = {To tackle the climate crisis, the European energy strategy relies on consumers taking ownership of the energy transition, accelerating decarbonisation through investments in low-carbon technologies and ensuring system stability and reliability by actively participating in the market. Therefore, tools are needed to better understand an increasingly complex and actor-dense energy system, tracking socio-technical dynamics that occur at its margins and then predicting the effects on larger scales. Yet, existing domestic energy demand models are not flexible enough to incorporate a wide range of socio-technical factors, and to be incorporated into larger energy system simulation environments. Here, a co-simulation design for domestic energy demand modeling is presented and motivated on the basis of four design principles: granularity, scalability, modularity and transparency. Microsimulation of domestic energy demand, through the Python open source library demod, shows that it is possible to achieve high detail and high temporal resolution without compromising scalability. Furthermore, mosaik, an open source co-simulation framework, makes it possible to generate, integrate and orchestrate a multitude of demod-based instances with other independent models, which for the illustrative purposes of this study are represented by a heat pump model. The authors hope that the detailed documentation of the proposed solution will encourage interdisciplinary and collaborative efforts to develop a simulation ecosystem capable of investigating alternative energy transition pathways and evaluating policy interventions through the socio-technical lens.},

	abstract = {National demand for electricity follows a regular and predictable daily pattern. This pattern is set to change due to efficiency improvements, de-industrialisation and electrification of heat and transport. These changes are independent of renewable infeed and are not well understood: contemporary studies assume that electricity load curves will retain their current shape, scaling equally in all hours. Changes to this shape will profoundly affect the electricity industry: increasing the requirements for flexible and peaking capacity, and reducing asset utilisation and profitability. This paper explores the evolution of load curves to 2050 in Germany and Britain: two countries undergoing radically different energy transformations. It reviews recent developments in Europe's electricity demand, and introduces two models for synthesising future hourly load curves: {eLOAD} (electricity {LOad} curve {ADjustment}) and {DESSTinEE} (Demand for Energy Services, Supply and Transmission in {EuropE}). Both models are applied to a decarbonisation scenario for 2050, and consistently show peak loads increasing by about 23\% points above the change in annual demand, to 103¬†{GW} in Germany and 92¬†{GW} in Britain. Sensitivities around electrification show that a million extra heat pumps or electric vehicles add up to 1.5¬†{GW} to peak demand. The structure and shape of the future load curves are analysed, and impacts on the national electricity systems are drawn.},

This paper introduces an open source modeling framework for evaluating risks from correlated hydrometeorological processes in electricity markets at decision relevant scales. The framework is able to reproduce historical price dynamics in high profile systems, while also offering unique capabilities for stochastic simulation. Synthetic generation of weather and hydrologic variables is coupled with simulation models of relevant infrastructure (dams, power plants).

This test system is validated by running it in a production cost model, with results compared against historical generation to ensure that they are representative.

	abstract = {Using a linear cost minimization model with a 1 h time resolution, we investigated the influence of geographic allocation of wind power on large-scale wind power investments, taking into account wind conditions, distance to load, and the nature of the power system in place (i.e. power generation and transmission capacities). We employed a hypothetical case in which a 20\% wind power share of total electricity demand is applied to the Nordic‚ÄìGerman power system. Free, i.e. geographically unrestricted, allocation of new wind power capacity is compared with a case in which national planning frameworks impose national limitations on wind power penetration levels. Given the cost assumptions made in the present work, the prospect of increasing the wind power capacity factor from 20 to 30\% could motivate investments in transmission capacity from northern Scandinavia to continental Europe. The results obtained using the model show that the distribution of wind farms between regions with favorable wind conditions is dependent upon two factors: (i) the extent to which existing lines can be used to transmit the electricity that results from the new wind power and (ii) the correlation for wind power generation between the exporting region and the wind power generation already in place. In addition, the results indicate that there is little difference, i.e. just over 1\%, in total yearly cost between the free allocation of new wind power and an allocation that complies with national planning frameworks. However, on a national level, there are significant differences with respect to investments in transmission and wind power capacities and the replacement of conventional power generation.

It includes a wide range of features and constraints, such as stochastic parameters, multiple reserve products, energy storage units, controlled and uncontrolled energy transfers, and, most significantly, multiple energy sectors. The formulation is based on mixed-integer programming and takes into account unit commitment decisions for power plants and other energy conversion facilities. Both high-level large-scale systems and fully detailed smaller-scale systems can be appropriately modelled. The framework has been implemented as the open-source Backbone modelling tool using General Algebraic Modeling System ({GAMS}). An application of the framework is demonstrated using a power system example, and Backbone is shown to produce results comparable to a commercial tool. However, the adaptability of Backbone further enables the creation and solution of energy systems models relatively easily for many different purposes and thus it improves on the available methodologies.},

	abstract = {According to the latest Global Tracking Framework (2015), 18\% of the global and 57\% of the African population live without access to electricity services‚Äîa key impediment towards social and economic growth. Accelerating access to electricity requires, inter alia, strategies and programmes that effectively address and account for the geographical, infrastructural and socioeconomic characteristics of a country or region. This paper focuses on considering these characteristics by developing a Geographic Information Systems ({GIS})-based methodology to inform electriÔ¨Åcation planning and strategies. The methodology is applied to Nigeria in order to identify the optimal mix of electriÔ¨Åcation options, ranging from grid extensions to mini-grid and off-grid solutions. The case study illustrates how this optimal mix is inÔ¨Çuenced by a range of parameters‚Äîincluding population density, existing and planned transmission networks and power plants, economic activities, tariffs for grid-based electricity, technology costs for mini-grid and off-grid systems and fuel costs for consumers. For a certain level of energy access, on-grid connections would be optimal for the majority of the new connections in Nigeria; grid extension constitutes the lowest cost option for approximately 86\% of the newly electriÔ¨Åed population in this modelling effort with 2030 as the time horizon. However, there are some remote areas with low population densities where a mini-grid or a stand-alone solution are the most economic options; deploying some combination of solar, wind, hydro and diesel technologies depending on the locational resource availability.},

Instrumental variable models using the between estimator, as well as dynamic panel models are employed to present robust estimates, and to assess the impact of different methodologies on the reported elasticities. The long-run price elasticity of residential electricity consumption is estimated between ‚àí0.53 and ‚àí0.56. These elasticities are more inelastic than that of industrial electricity use, which is reported between ‚àí0.75 and ‚àí1.01. The choice of different econometric methodologies has only moderate impact on the estimates. While long-run residential income elasticity estimates are moderately inelastic and estimated around 0.61, industrial electricity use tends to be closely tied to income, with elasticities between 0.76 and 1.08. Electricity demand in all sectors is highly price and income inelastic in the short run. Additionally, population density, temperatures, and policy measures also influence sectoral electricity use. The above estimates can aid the design of European energy and environmental policy.},

This paper quantitatively summarizes the recent, but sizeable, empirical evidence to facilitate a sounder economic assessment of (in some cases policy-related) energy price changes.

Meanwhile, the scalarization method creates multi-objective functions made into a single solution using weights. There are three types of weights in scalarization which are equal weights, rank order centroid weights, and rank-sum weights. Next, the solution using the Pareto method is a performance indicators component that forms {MOO} a separate and produces a compromise solution and can be displayed in the form of Pareto optimal front, while the solution using the scalarization method is a performance indicators component that forms a scalar function which is incorporated in the fitness function.},

Accelerated technological progress and policy implementations are required to deliver emissions reductions at rates sufficiently fast to avoid crossing dangerous tipping points in the Earth‚Äôs climate system. Here, we discuss and evaluate the potential of social tipping interventions ({STIs}) that can activate contagious processes of rapidly spreading technologies, behaviors, social norms, and structural reorganization within their functional domains that we refer to as social tipping elements ({STEs}). {STEs} are subdomains of the planetary socioeconomic system where the required disruptive change may take place and lead to a sufficiently fast reduction in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The results are based on online expert elicitation, a subsequent expert workshop, and a literature review. The {STIs} that could trigger the tipping of {STE} subsystems include 1) removing fossil-fuel subsidies and incentivizing decentralized energy generation ({STE}1, energy production and storage systems), 2) building carbon-neutral cities ({STE}2, human settlements), 3) divesting from assets linked to fossil fuels ({STE}3, financial markets), 4) revealing the moral implications of fossil fuels ({STE}4, norms and value systems), 5) strengthening climate education and engagement ({STE}5, education system), and 6) disclosing information on greenhouse gas emissions ({STE}6, information feedbacks).

	abstract = {Despite recent technical advances, there is a risk that commercial-scale fusion will not play a substantial role in mitigating climate change or alleviating energy poverty due to a lack of public or community support, often referred to as a lack of a social license. This risk is not academic‚Äîother technologies, such as fission reactors, spent fuel waste repositories (e.g., Yucca Mountain), genetically modified foods, onshore and offshore wind turbines, electrical transmission lines, and even vaccines, struggle due to rejection by a substantial fraction of society, in other words, a lack of social acceptance. Conventional approaches to this challenge, such as risk-reducing technical solutions (e.g., replacing fission with fusion), or better ‚Äúcommunication‚Äù or ‚Äúeducation,‚Äù are unlikely, on their own, to be sufficient to mitigate this risk. Fortunately, fusion is sufficiently young that it has an opportunity to distinguish itself from other energy technologies not just in the way that it uses physics, but also in the way that it approaches society. In particular, fusion can anticipate, rather than react to, public concerns. Looking to other industries and fields of research, this paper describes the risk of a lack of public support and methods to achieve such support, including a social license, bio-ethical review, and responsible research and innovation. These methods are discussed in the context of seven case studies, illustrating practical application. The paper concludes with recommendations for specific steps that fusion companies, non-governmental organizations, academic researchers, government funders, and government regulators can take now to facilitate a long-term social license for fusion energy.},

	abstract = {The shift from carbon-intensive to low-carbon energy systems has profound justice implications as some regions are likely to lose as much as gain from decarbonization processes. Increasing calls have been made to adopt a ‚Äòwhole systems‚Äô perspective on energy justice. Drawing on the Multi-level Perspective on socio-technical transitions this paper presents a new comprehensive framework of energy justice in system innovation, proposing to map injustices along three dimensions: 1) multiple spatial scales (regional, national, international); 2) different time horizons (currently experienced vs. anticipated injustices); 3) connections to transition dynamics (injustices related to the optimization of the currently dominant system, destabilization of the incumbent system or the acceleration of alternative solutions in niches). The framework is applied to analyse the ongoing energy transition in Estonia, involving interactions between the incumbent oil shale based regime and wind, solar, nuclear and bioenergy as emerging niche challengers. The content analysis of news items in Estonian media reveals an inventory of 214 distinct incidents of energy injustices across 21 different categories. We find that many experienced and anticipated injustices are deployed, often strategically, by certain actors to advocate specific energy futures and to influence current political choices. From the justice perspective our analysis thus raises a question whether it is ethical to use probable yet currently unrealized injustices related to regime destabilization and niche acceleration as a means to perpetuate injustices related to the optimization of the currently dominant regime.},

The article examines changes in transboundary trust in and between the actors relevant for decision-making regarding the plant, during the three phases of the conflict. It focuses on three aspects, which shaped the development of transboundary trust: first, the role played by pre-existing structures of cross-border institutional, interpersonal and ideological trust, secondly, practices of trust-building that various actors applied to maintain, enhance or rebuild transboundary trust, and thirdly, the growing discourses of mistrust and even distrust in the institutions advocating the use of nuclear power ‚Äì regardless on which side of the border they were located. The article argues that changes in contemporary views on nuclear risk and the concomitant politicisation of the issue of nuclear power broadened the range of relevant actors, and contributed to changing trust relations. It suggests a mutually reinforcing interaction between interpersonal, institutional and ideological trust, and finds few differences in discourses about institutional trust between transboundary and domestic authorities. Its findings highlight the importance of productive mistrust for nuclear safety, and thus demonstrate that both trust and mistrust are important for living with, but also for limiting (nuclear) risk.},

Decarbonization highlights the need for fit-for-purpose assessment tools as energy systems undergo an expected transition from mostly fossil to mostly nonfossil resources. Energy use has historically been a high-quality proxy for socioenvironmental impacts of interest, but this characteristic depends on the relatively stable historical relationship between energy use (typically measured as exchanges of marketed energy resources and carriers like natural gas and electricity) and these impacts‚Äîa relationship that is increasingly weak. Already, energy use metrics used in tools like energy footprinting and life cycle assessment have developed maladaptations to include nonfossil resources, including many flow resources. For example, nonmarketed energy use is typically ignored; metrics like heat rate are applied to nonthermal resources in ways with limited physical meaning; and definitional exceptions are made without clear justification. Part of the challenge is that energy is a conserved quantity with highly variable quality, but energy footprint metrics have historically implicitly assumed that all energy, and energy use, is the same. The assessment community can improve the clarity and value of energy use quantification under decarbonization by drawing on the experience of footprinting with another highly heterogeneous conserved resource: water. This discussion introduces the concept of a yellow, red, and brown energy footprint framework as an expansion of traditional energy footprinting and analogue of the green, blue, and grey water footprinting framework.},

	abstract = {As energy systems decarbonize, their environmental impacts will change. Historically, energy consumption has been a reliable proxy for environmental impacts of interest due to the dominance of fossil fuel combustion. With a normative transition to decarbonized energy, however, environmental assessment of energy systems faces two major paradigm shifts: 1) environmental profiles are likely to be dominated by embodied rather than operational impacts; and 2) the primary analytical need is for prospective and trustworthy analysis to support system design decisions. Ensuring that analysis of diverse potential decarbonized futures is rigorous and granted legitimacy by potential users is critical if such analysis is to be used and useful as decision support. This review uses both computational and narrative methods to evaluate the English language literature on 12 environmental impact categories and 18 types of decarbonized energy resources or energy carriers to ask: what issues does environmental assessment need to be able to rigorously evaluate to support decisions about designing a decarbonized energy supply? We find that embodied impacts are likely to dominate. We suggest that land use metrics might displace energy consumption as the best single proxy for overall energy supply system impacts, though translating land use inventory data to environmental impacts requires significantly more contextualization than does fossil fuel combustion. Individual energy resources or energy carriers have diverse potential environmental impacts that are highly context dependent and dynamic under technological and environmental change, which suggests that mitigation pathways might depend on project design choices more than technological mitigation.},

To address this problem, a set of guidelines for a fairer, wiser, and more workable siting process‚Äîthe Facility Siting Credo‚Äîwas developed during a National Facility Siting Workshop in 1990. This paper presents an empirical test of these guidelines. A questionnaire based on the Credo was completed by stakeholders in 29 waste facility siting cases, both successful and unsuccessful, across the United States and Canada. Using an independent determination of outcome (success), a preliminary ranking of the importance of various Credo principles was obtained. The data reveal that establishing trust between the developer and host community is an important factor in facilitating the siting process. The siting process is most likely to be successful when the community perceives the facility design to be appropriate and to satisfy its needs. Public participation also is seen to be an important process variable, particularly if it encourages a view that the facility best meets community needs. Moreover, a siting process where communities volunteer to host facilities is an approach that holds promise for meeting many of these key success criteria.},

The prevailing consensus among movement scholars is that the prospect for movement emergence is facilitated by the confluence of three factors: the expansion of political opportunities, the availability of mobilizing structures, and cognitive and affective mobilization through framing processes. The author then applies each of these factors to the case of climate change, arguing that (a) awareness of the issue developed during an especially inopportune period in American politics, (b) the organizations that arose to address the issue were ill suited to the kind of grassroots mobilization characteristic of successful movements, and (c) the amorphous nature of the issue played havoc with efforts at strategic framing.},

	abstract = {Low-carbon generating technologies vary significantly in the employment that
they create.
Employment is created largely during the construction stage and throughout
the network of supply chain companies needed to maintain operations.
Most employment estimates in the sector are ‚Äòpoint-in-time‚Äô, i.e. they provide
a snapshot rather than a view over the entire plant lifetime. The rapid growth
of wind power thus distorts the contribution it might make in a ‚Äòsteady state‚Äô of
neither growth nor decline.
This paper uses existing studies for specified countries to estimate employment
in a steady state for both nuclear and wind energy.
By separating employment into several distinct stages ‚Äì construction;
operations and maintenance; supply chain; and decommissioning ‚Äì a steady
state employment estimate is presented for the generation of 1000 {TWh} of
electricity over a year. On the basis of data from France and the {USA}, for this
amount of electricity nuclear creates 461,000 jobs to wind‚Äôs 346,000 jobs, i.e.
about 25\% more employment per unit of electricity than wind power.
Other attractive features of nuclear sector employment include comparatively
good pay, long-term job security and a high degree of localisation in the
host country.
Although nuclear generation requires significant investment in employment,
it maintains a competitive advantage over intermittent sources of low-carbon
electricity such as wind. As a highly reliable and stable source of electricity,
nuclear generation does not require additional investment in backup capacity
or storage, while investments in grids are relatively low. When the total costs
of the plant and system are taken into account, nuclear offers not only more

Theconstruction of the 1,172-mile pipeline raised questions about the public‚Äôs ability to influence energy infrastructure development considered by the {US} government as ‚Äúcritical‚Äù to national security. While numerous scholars and courts have begun to question whether thefederalregulatory process that permitted {DAPL} sufficiently allowed for participation, less work has examinedstate-levelprocesses. In this article, we ask whether actors who participated in the regulatory process at the state-level had sufficient opportunity to influence the siting, permitting, and construction of {DAPL}. We focus on Illinois, analyzing the 2015 proceeding by the Illinois Commerce Commission ({ICC}) to permit {DAPL}. Drawing on fieldwork between October 2018 and May 2020, we argue the {ICC} regulatory process minimized the space available for pipeline opposition in three ways. First, the {ICC} is limited, in an institutional design sense, from integrating broad public opinion into its decision-making process. Second, as a function of its design, pipeline opponents required significant knowledge and resources to mount claims before the {ICC}. Finally, we contend that politically powerful interest groups, especially labor unions and industry stakeholders, shape pipeline politics in Illinois in ways that further limit avenues for formal opposition. Our work raises important questions about the impact of public participation in contemporary energy and environmental governance, as well as how democratic contestation surrounding oil pipelines can openspacefor resistance and transformativesocial change.},

	abstract = {Decarbonizing the United States energy system is a challenging task. The situation is exacerbated by the lack of strong federal climate policy, leaving individual states and institutions to drive the energy sector towards net-zero carbon emissions. {ESOM} tools use linear programming to develop policy insights that may help achieve full decarbonization. However, there is a widely recognized tradeoff between model complexity and computational cost. Adding spatial, temporal, and technological details make these models more realistic, but may make them computationally intractable. Previously, most {ESOM} studies prioritize technology options over spatial or temporal detail. This choice emphasizes the role of technology costs, such as fuel and capital costs, on energy policy without considering operational challenges. This thesis uses the {ESOM}, Temoa to model Illinois‚Äô and the University of Illinois‚Äô energy systems and develops the {PyGenesys} tool to facilitate sensitivity analysis. The sensitivities considered in this work are temporal resolution and the annual capacity factors of wind and solar energy, or the inter-annual variability.

The results of the time resolution study showed that any temporal aggregation above an hourly level may generate misleading results that minimizes the roles of firm clean power and energy storage. Additionally, the role of wind energy is overestimated in models with less temporal detail, and the roles of solar energy and advanced nuclear reactors are underestimated. The study of inter-annual variability showed that energy systems with majority variable intermittent renewables, such as solar and wind, that exclude clean firm power from nuclear power plants exhibit higher energy costs with nearly 63 times the variance of systems that use a majority of clean firm power. Additionally, the amount of capacity necessary to meet electricity demand is greater and more uncertain in systems with high renewable penetration. Finally, based on the results in each of the sensitivity analyses, this thesis recommends that Illinois continues supporting its existing nuclear fleet with ‚Äúzero emissions credits‚Äù and expand clean firm capacity with advanced nuclear reactors by lifting the moratorium on new nuclear builds.},

The challenge is more acute given the projected doubling of global energy consumption by 2050 and widespread electrification of transportation and industry. Yet unlike greenhouse gas emissions, land use intensity of energy has been rarely studied in a rigorous way. Here we calculate land-use intensity of energy ({LUIE}) for real-world sites across all major sources of electricity, integrating data from published literature, databases, and original data collection. We find a range of {LUIE} that span four orders of magnitude, from nuclear with 7.1 ha/{TWh}/y to dedicated biomass at 58,000 ha/{TWh}/y. By applying these {LUIE} results to the future electricity portfolios of ten energy scenarios, we conclude that land use could become a significant constraint on deep decarbonization of the power system, yet low-carbon, land-efficient options are available.},

	abstract = {High-profile modelling studies often project that large-scale win‚Äìwin solutions are widely available, but practitioners are often sceptical of win‚Äìwin narratives, due to real-world complexity. Here we bridge this divide by showing mathematically why complexity makes win‚Äìwins elusive. We provide a general proof that increasing the number of objectives, the number of stakeholders or the number of constraints decreases the availability of win‚Äìwin outcomes (here meaning Pareto improvements). We also show that a measure of tradeoff severity increases in the number of objectives. As the number of objectives approaches infinity, we show that this tradeoff severity measure approaches a limit unaffected by the curvature of the tradeoff surface. This is surprising because concave tradeoff-surface curvature results in less severe tradeoffs with fewer objectives. Our theory suggests that this difference gradually dissipates as objectives are added. In a meta-analysis, we show that 77\% of empirically estimated two-objective tradeoff surfaces are concave. We then show how to approximately extrapolate our tradeoff severity measure to higher numbers of objectives, starting from estimated tradeoffs between fewer objectives. Our results provide modellers with precise intuition into practitioners‚Äô scepticism of win‚Äìwin narratives and practitioners with guidance for assessing the implications of simple tradeoff models.},

	abstract = {Energy transition is a fundamental part of the policy response to climate change, but unlike climate change, we know little about the factors that shape public attitudes about it. We address three questions: 1) how supportive are people of energy transition, 2) how do pre-existing ideas ‚Äì about politics, economics, climate change, and energy ‚Äì affect public views on energy transition, and 3) how malleable is public opinion about transition? Using the Canadian province of Alberta ‚Äì a context where oil and gas are politically and economically predominant ‚Äìwe assess these questions with a population-based survey experiment (n = 1591). Results indicate that energy transition is widely popular. Pre-existing values and beliefs about the economy; political identification with the left-right spectrum; worry about climate change; and hope in the future of oil and gas as a predominant industry strongly structure attitudes about transition. We argue that championing the economic benefits of clean energy will not be persuasive with people who continue to have high hopes in the future economic benefits of fossil fuels. Instead, we suggest policy makers focus instead on the economic risks that come from continued reliance on fossil fuels.},

Although it is projected that wind power will be the main contributor in the energy transition, due to its spatial implications it is targeted by considerable local opposition, thus jeopardising the success of many wind energy projects. Previous research has found that distributive and procedural justice issues are common factors inÔ¨Çuencing local public acceptance. This paper explores local public preferences for different forms of Ô¨Ånancial and procedural participation by means of choice experiments and focus groups. The results show that wind power projects are generally accepted by the local public if certain condition, i.e. shareholding and high levels of participation in the decision-making process are oÔ¨Äered. Policy recommendations are given on how wind power projects should be implemented so as to counteract local opposition.

            Public support is a key determinant of whether any energy project is developed in democratic countries. In recent decades, scholars have extensively examined levels of support and opposition to energy infrastructure, often with a focus on so-called Not-in-My-Backyard ({NIMBY}) sentiments. As the need for energy infrastructure grows, so does the need to extract insights and lessons from this literature. In this systematic literature review, we evaluate decades of research to identify important trends in topical focus, research findings, and research design. We find a disproportionate focus on wind energy, followed by solar, fossil fuels, and transmission, with most studies conducted in the United States or United Kingdom, and that individuals are more often supportive of energy projects than they are opposed. Scholars have examined the role of many factors in understanding attitudes toward energy infrastructure, and often find knowledge, trust, and positive perceptions about the benefits of projects to be positively correlated with support for projects, although with variation across energy types. {NIMBY} attitudes differ widely in approach and are often plagued by problematic research designs that limit inferences and the generalizability of findings. We provide a detailed discussion of these limitations and suggest areas in which the literature can expand.},

Therefore, it is important to understand what mediates local opposition and oppositional action so potential concerns can be addressed earlier. Results indicate that Carolina coast residents are supportive of local offshore wind energy development, despite little to no awareness of such developments and uncertainty about potential impacts. Awareness and certainty of impacts are the largest drivers of support level, followed by perceived impacts. Residents generally believe local offshore wind energy will improve local economies but damage the environment; however, perceived impacts vary by factor importance. About twice as many Carolina coast residents intend social action related to local offshore wind energy compared to those who have engaged in related past actions. Holding a strong position and engagement in past actions are the largest drivers of intended action. For those in strong opposition, increased place attachment increases the odds of intending action, suggesting place-protective action.

Mounting awareness of the climate crisis has placed increasing importance on developing renewable energy sources, however, advances in fossil fuel extraction technology have opened vast domestic reserves of oil and natural gas. Public preferences for energy policy play a role in determining energy futures, but researchers rarely simultaneously compare public views across multiple renewable and non-renewable energies or across country boundaries. Here, we used a 2019 online survey sample (n = 1500) to compare predictors of support for eight fuel sources for electricity generation in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington and Oregon, {USA}. Results indicate the highest support overall for renewables (wind, solar, wave/tidal energy, geothermal) and the lowest for fossil fuels (coal and natural gas), nuclear, and hydropower. Mixed-eÔ¨Äects regression modeling indicates that views on climate and the balance between environment and economy were consistent predictors of support across most energy types, while political ideology was less consistent. Perceived local importance of both extractive and renewable energy industries were signiÔ¨Åcant predictors of support for some, but not all, energy sources, as were education and gender. Overall, our research suggests that while divisions persist in public energy preferences for both renewable and non-renewable sources, there is the broadest support for renewable energy technologies.},

This problem is solved by implementing an -constraint method. The solution consists of a Pareto front, corresponding to different design strategies in the associated variable space. Multiple choice decision making is then recommended to Ô¨Ånd the best solution through an M-{TOPSIS} analysis.

In particular, we developed a mixed-integer linear programming model with multiple objectives at a neighbourhood level containing residential and ofÔ¨Åce buildings. The equipment and layout of the district energy (power, heating, and cooling) networks were selected from several potential energy devices and paths using a mathematical model. The objectives of the model were to minimize the total annual cost and {CO}2 (carbon dioxide) emission and achieve the optimal design and operation to meet the yearly energy demands. Moreover, the economic and environmental beneÔ¨Åts under different weights of the objective function were evaluated by sensitivity analysis. The results show that at a neighbourhood level, the {DER} system has signiÔ¨Åcant environmental and economic beneÔ¨Åts. The system could spontaneously select the most appropriate operation strategy using the developed mathematical model. In multiobjective scenarios, with the increase in the weight of environmental factor, the emission decreases and the cost increases gradually. When considering a single objective, the minimization of cost or carbon emission leads to a poor cost performance.},

The proposed scenarios typically rely on a mixing of different energy sources, thereby mitigating the availability and intermittency problems typically related to renewable technologies.

To this purpose, this article presents a generalized framework coupling {EnergyPLAN} ‚Äì a descriptive analytical model for medium/large-scale energy systems ‚Äì with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm ‚Äì a type of optimizer widely used in the context of complex problems. By using this framework, it is possible to automatically identify a set of Pareto-optimal conÔ¨Ågurations with respect to different competing objectives. As an example, the method is applied to the case of Aalborg municipality, Denmark, by choosing cost and carbon emission minimization as contrasting goals. Results are compared with a manually identiÔ¨Åed scenario, taken from previous literature. The automatic approach, while conÔ¨Årming that the available manual solution is very close to optimality, yields an entire set of additional optimal solutions, showing its effectiveness in the simultaneous analysis of a wide range of combinations. √ì 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

While beneÔ¨Åting from local biomass resources Finnish energy system is deemed to achieve this goal, increasing the share of other intermittent renewables is under development, namely wind power and solar energy. Yet the maximum Ô¨Çexibility of the existing energy system in integration of renewable energy is not investigated, which is an important step before undertaking new renewable energy obligations. This study aims at Ô¨Ålling this gap by hourly analysis and comprehensive modeling of the energy system including electricity, heat, and transportation, by employing {EnergyPLAN} tool. Focusing on technical and economic implications, we assess the maximum potential of different {RESs} separately (including bioenergy, hydropower, wind power, solar heating and {PV}, and heat pumps), as well as an optimal mix of different technologies. Furthermore, we propose a new index for assessing the maximum Ô¨Çexibility of energy systems in absorbing variable renewable energy. The results demonstrate that wind energy can be harvested at maximum levels of 18e19\% of annual power demand (approx. 16 {TWh}/a), without major enhancements in the Ô¨Çexibility of energy infrastructure. With today's energy demand, the maximum feasible renewable energy for Finland is around 44e50\% by an optimal mix of different technologies, which promises 35\% reduction in carbon emissions from 2012's level. Moreover, Finnish energy system is Ô¨Çexible to augment the share of renewables in gross electricity consumption up to 69 e72\%, at maximum. Higher shares of {RES} calls for lower energy consumption (energy efÔ¨Åciency) and more Ô¨Çexibility in balancing energy supply and consumption (e.g. by energy storage).},

Simulations have been conducted in the {EnergyPLAN} model for the year 2012. After the simulation presented promising scenarios, applying the Pareto analysis showed the optimal scenario for generating electricity from renewables, scenario with the lowest import of electricity, scenario with the lowest {CO}2 emissions and with the lowest critical excess electricity production. In addition, all of the scenarios were subjected to a multiple criteria decision analysis in order to Ô¨Ånd the best overall scenario. After showing that the best overall scenario was 1.65 {GW} of wind power plants and 1.6 {GW} of installed {PV} capacity, a multi-criteria analysis was performed in order to observe the behaviour of grading the scenarios.

This paper presents a novel approach for defining energy system of a carbon neutral island which utilizes only intermittent renewable energy sources in combination with vehicle-to-grid concept as a demand response technology, where marine transportation has also been taken into account. Integration of power, heating, cooling and transport sectors has been modelled by using {EnergyPLAN} tool, i.e. its updated November 2017 version which is capable of simulating vehicle-to-grid operation in mentioned conditions. Power supply capacities have been selected not by using scenario analysis but by implementing an optimization procedure based on series of simulations in {EnergyPLAN} tool. In order to choose the most suitable power supply system configuration, two boundary conditions have been defined. Firstly, only solar and wind capacities must be utilized. Secondly, total electricity import and export must be balanced, i.e. the island has to be {CO}2 neutral. In order to validate the approach, Croatian Island of Korƒçula has been used as the case study. 2011 has been selected as the base year for which final energy consumption has been calculated. The final simulation year was set to 2030 in which optimal capacities are installed. It has been shown that configuration with 40 {MW} of wind and 6 {MW} of installed solar capacities presents the least cost solution, while 22 {MW} of wind in combination with 30 {MW} of installed solar capacities provides the lowest amount of total electricity import and export. Analysis of the vehicle-to-grid share reduction has shown increase in total import and export in both cases, while transmission peak loads have not been influenced.},

Nuclear power plants, with a large ratio of capital to variable costs, have historically operated as base load energy suppliers but the need for more flexible operation is increasing. We simulate the techno-economic performance of a 950 {MWt} nuclear power plant, based on the Westinghouse lead-cooled fast reactor, coupled with molten salt thermal storage as a method for flexible energy dispatch. We use the System Advisor Model to model the nuclear reactor thermal power input and power cycle operating modes. We combine this robust engineering model with a mixed-integer linear program model for optimized dispatch scheduling. We then simulate the coupled nuclear and thermal storage system under different market scenarios with varying price volatility. We find that the coupled plant outperforms the base plant under markets where energy price peaks fluctuate by a factor of two or more about the mean price. We show that a calculated power purchase agreement price for the plant improves by up to 10\% when operating under California energy market conditions.

	abstract = {We utilize a newly developed framework called Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis (Temoa) to perform multi-stage stochastic optimization of a simple energy system. The system consists of 27 technologies used to supply primary energy resources, refine petroleum products, generate electricity, and serve end use demands. The model considers stochastic crude oil and natural gas prices over 4 time periods, resulting in a total of 256 scenarios. Model results indicate that future changes in oil price may have a larger effect on system cost than natural gas prices, but overall the system configuration requires little recourse as fuel price uncertainty is revealed over time. This analysis represents an early step towards our goal of applying stochastic optimization in a high performance computing environment to develop robust, near-term hedging strategies for energy system management.},

However, there is a concern that the uncertainties inherent in the model structures and input parameters are at best underplayed and at worst ignored. Compared to other types of energy models, {ESOMs} tend to use scenarios to handle uncertainties or treat them as a marginal issue. Without adequately addressing uncertainties, the model insights may be limited, lack robustness, and may mislead decision makers. This paper provides an in-depth review of systematic techniques that address uncertainties for {ESOMs}. We have identiÔ¨Åed four prevailing uncertainty approaches that have been applied to {ESOM} type models: Monte Carlo analysis, stochastic programming, robust optimization, and modelling to generate alternatives. For each method, we review the principles, techniques, and how they are utilized to improve the robustness of the model results to provide extra policy insights. In the end, we provide a critical appraisal on the use of these methods.},

The climate mitigation cost savings of the existing U.S. nuclear fleet is denominated in hundreds of billions of dollars [net present value ({NPV})] based on an integrated assessment modeling of the U.S. energy system within a globally consistent framework. Lifetime extensions of the existing nuclear fleet from 40 years to 60 and 100 years resulted in \$330 billion to \$500 billion (all figures are in U.S. dollars) ({NPV}) of mitigation cost savings for the United States under a deep decarbonization scenario consistent with limiting global temperature change to 2¬∞C. The addition of new nuclear deployments in the United States increased the total U.S. mitigation cost savings of the 2¬∞C climate goal by up to \$750 billion ({NPV}). Immediate actions are required in the United States and globally to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by mid-century, and once achieving net-zero emissions, they must remain at net-zero indefinitely. Lifetime extensions of the existing nuclear fleet, in the United States and globally, support urgent near-term emissions reduction goals. Additionally, the longevity of nuclear power technologies reduces the need for new capacity additions of all carbon-free electricity sources and supports long-term actions necessary to maintain net-zero emissions.},

	abstract = {This article reviews climate change mitigation policies implemented in five major emitting economies: China, the European Union, India, Japan and the United States. It analyses their historical performance in terms of energy system and greenhouse gas emissions indicators. In cases where policies aim to reduce future emissions, their target performance levels are assessed. The review centres on the sectors of electricity generation, passenger vehicles, freight transport, forestry, industry, buildings, agriculture, and oil and gas production. Most focus countries have implemented successful policies for renewable energy, fuel efficiency, electrification of passenger vehicles, and forestry. For other sectors, information is limited or very heterogeneous (e.g. buildings, appliances, agriculture) or there are few comprehensive policies in place (e.g. industry). The article further presents an explorative emissions scenario developed under the assumption that all countries will replicate both the observed trends in sector-level indicators and the trends that policies for future emissions reductions aspire to achieve. It shows that the global replication of sector progress would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 by about 20\% compared to a current policies scenario. All countries analysed would overachieve the emissions reduction targets in their post-2020 climate targets. However, the resulting reduction in global emissions by 2030 would still not be sufficient to keep the world on track for a global cost-effective pathway that keeps temperature increase below 2¬∞C. The findings of this study emphasise the need for transformative policies to keep the Paris Agreement temperature limit within reach.},

After decades of weatherization and bill-payment programs, low-income households still spend a higher percent of their income on electricity and gas bills than any other income group. Their energy burden is not declining, and it remains persistently high in particular geographies such as the South, rural America, and minority communities. As public agencies and utilities attempt to transition to a sustainable energy future, many of the programs that promote energy efficiency, rooftop solar, electric vehicles, and home batteries are largely inaccessible to low-income households due to affordability barriers. This review describes the ecosystem of stakeholders and programs, and identifies promising opportunities to address low-income energy affordability, such as behavioral economics, data analytics, and leveraging health care benefits. Scalable approaches require linking programs and policies to tackle the complex web of causes and impacts faced by financially constrained households.},

Several analyses have shown that nuclear technologies may represent very attractive options for greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emission reductions, especially in countries with high growth projections for energy demand. Our objective is to analyze the role of nuclear energy in long-term climate scenarios using the World-{TIMES} (The Integrated {MARKAL}-{EFOM} System) bottom-up model. World-{TIMES} is a global model that optimizes the energy system of 15 regions over a 100-year horizon (2000‚Äì2100). We present energy and emission results for climate scenarios for two levels of {CO}2 concentration (450 and 550ppmv by 2100). We analyze the penetration level of nuclear energy under various sets of assumptions on technology parameters and exogenous constraints on nuclear development to reflect social perceptions. Nuclear energy technologies satisfy a large portion of electricity production in many regions. Most regions experience an energy transition based on advanced oil and gas technologies and hydropower. Other renewable technologies might play a more important role but need further cost reductions or new regulations to penetrate the market in substantial proportions. Carbon sequestration and endogenous demand reductions for energy services are also significantly contributing to reach environmental target.},

Make no mistake, the growth is customer driven. So, what does the future hold for microgrids? If customers continue to seek cost predictability, sustainability, and reliability/resilience in their energy services, then long-term growth in the microgrid industry should be obvious, even in the face of resistance from utilities and policymakers. Where will microgrids be in 2035? 2050? Will utilities embrace microgrids? Will policymakers become facilitators of microgrids? Will municipalities and rural cooperatives use microgrids to hedge costs and improve sustainability and resilience for their citizens/members?

Community microgrids are, however, complex to implement and institutional change is needed to reach their full potential. The purpose of this article is to review existing literature and analyze institutional developments influencing the growth of community microgrids. The literature describes a concentration of microgrid activities in specific regions: {USA}, {EU}, Asia and Australia. Varying reasons for implementing community microgrids were found in the different regions but similar institutional developments occurred, albeit with differing emphasis due to contextual specificities. Formal directions do however influence informal institutions even though their aims differ. Power utilities stand out as a critical actor and both formal and informal institutions put pressure on utilities to update their traditional business models. This article illustrates how informal and formal institutions play a significant role in the growth of community microgrids in existing electricity grids and provide interesting examples which can be utilized by policymakers. Microgrid development is still in a formative phase and further institutional change in the form of updated regulations is needed.},

However, to reliably meet 100\% of total annual electricity demand, seasonal cycles and unpredictable weather events require several weeks‚Äô worth of energy storage and/or the installation of much more capacity of solar and wind power than is routinely necessary to meet peak demand. To obtain ‚àº80\% reliability, solar-heavy wind/solar generation mixes require sufficient energy storage to overcome the daily solar cycle, whereas wind-heavy wind/solar generation mixes require continental-scale transmission to exploit the geographic diversity of wind.

We propose a simple estimator, and we suggest resampling methods for inference. We then provide several macroeconomic applications. First, we illustrate the implementation of predictability measures based on fitted parametric models for several U.S. macroeconomic time series. Second, we analyze the internal propagation mechanism of a standard dynamic macroeconomic model by comparing the predictability of model inputs and model outputs. Third, we use predictability as a metric for assessing the similarity of data simulated from the model and actual data. Finally, we outline several nonparametric extensions of our approach.},

A system is said to be unpredictable if the forecast distribution, which gives the most complete description of the future state based on all available knowledge, is identical to the climatological distribution, which describes the state in the absence of time lag information. It follows that a necessary condition for predictability is for the forecast and climatological distributions to differ. Information theory provides a powerful framework for quantifying the difference between two distributions that agrees with intuition about predictability. Three information theoretic measures have been proposed in the literature: predictive information, relative entropy, and mutual information. These metrics are discussed with the aim of clarifying their similarities and differences. All three metrics have attractive properties for defining predictability, including the fact that they are invariant with respect to nonsingular linear transformations, decrease monotonically in stationary Markov systems in some sense, and are easily decomposed into components that optimize them (in certain cases). Relative entropy and predictive information have the same average value, which in turn equals the mutual information. Optimization of mutual information leads naturally to canonical correlation analysis, when the variables are joint normally distributed. Closed form expressions of these metrics for finite dimensional, stationary, Gaussian, Markov systems are derived. Relative entropy and predictive information differ most significantly in that the former depends on the ‚Äúsignal to noise ratio‚Äù of a single forecast distribution, whereas the latter does not. Part {II} of this paper discusses the extension of these concepts to imperfect forecast models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {After more than 40 years the so-called Hurst effect remains an open problem in stochastic hydrology. Historically, its existence has been explained either by preasymptotic behavior of the rescaled adjusted range , certain classes of nonstationarity in time series, infinite memory, or erroneous estimation of the Hurst exponent. Various statistical tests to determine whether an observed time series exhibits the Hurst effect are presented. The tests are based on the fact that for the family of processes in the Brownian domain of attraction, converges in distribution to a nondegenerate random variable with known distribution (functional central limit theorem). The scale of fluctuation Œ∏, defined as the sum of the correlation function, plays a key role. Application of the tests to several geophysical time series seems to indicate that they do not exhibit the Hurst effect, although those series have been used as examples of its existence, and furthermore the traditional pox diagram method to estimate the Hurst exponent gives values larger than 0.5. It turned out that the coefficient in the relation of versus n, which is directly proportional to the scale of fluctuation, was more important than the exponent. The Hurst effect motivated the popularization of 1/f noises and related ideas of fractals and scaling. This work illustrates how delicate the procedures to deal with infinity must be.},

Because of the complex nature of rainfall, the uncertainty associated with its predictability continues to be an issue in rainfall forecasting. The Hurst exponent is considered as a measure of persistence and it is believed that if a time series has persistence (as reflected by a Hurst exponent value greater than 0.5) it is also predictable. However, very limited studies have been carried out to demonstrate this hypothesis. This study, through experimental work on hypothetical data as well as real data, demonstrates that the Hurst exponent can be taken as an indicator for predictability provided that the exponent values at ‚Äúsmaller levels‚Äù of the time series are also significantly greater than 0.5 together with the Hurst exponent of the overall time series. It is also shown that it is better to predict the ‚Äúsimilarity‚Äù aspect associated with a time series (and derive the predicted rainfall) than to predict the rainfall directly.},

In addition to renewable generation uncertainties, the uncertainty of loads and system component's probable failure make predicting the power systems state more and more difficult. The correlation between uncertain variables intensifies this challenge. Accurately predicting the power network state has significant importance mainly in the decision-making process of system operation, bidding strategies, and management of risk. This study proposes an optimal location and reference set point for static synchronous series compensator ({SSSC}) for maximizing the system predictability, minimizing the total active power loss, and increasing the reliability of the system, simultaneously. A multi-objective biogeography-based optimization ({MOBBO}) algorithm is used to handle the multiple objective functions considering the operational constraints. The uncertainty of the system is modeled using the Latin hypercube sampling ({LHS}) method and the correlation between uncertain variables is handled by the Cholesky decomposition technique. The necessity of considering predictability indices in obtaining optimal location and setting point of the {SSSC} are comprehensively discussed. The probability distributions of apparent power and voltage magnitude of the {SSSC} converter are obtained, which can be very useful in deciding on the sizing of {SSSC}. The performance and advantage of the presented method are evaluated through simulation reports and investigation on the {IEEE} 57-bus system.},

	abstract = {The number of large-scale photovoltaic ({PV}) and wind farms is rapidly growing in Australia and all around the world. When these resources participate in the wholesale electricity market, their uncertain nature of generation results in revenue loss due to the penalty incurred by deviating from day-ahead and real-time commitments. In an attempt to avoid financial losses, they typically bid in the market conservatively. This, in turn, might lead to wasting clean energy and lowering overall profit for the producers. To address these issues, various energy storage devices are considered as a potential solution by academic and industrial researchers alike. In this study, an optimal battery sizing methodology is proposed to improve renewable generation predictability using ‚ÄúSeasonal-Trend decomposition based on {LOESS}‚Äù1 decomposition technique, self-similarity estimation, and enhancing it through filtering. The ultimate goal is to determine the optimal battery size that enhances predictability of renewable generation regardless of the prediction technique and time horizon, which necessarily improves the accuracy of predicted values. The goal is achieved by the proposed method through designing a forecasting-technique-agnostic algorithm. For optimal battery sizing, an optimization formulation is proposed including battery degradation through its useful lifetime. Moreover, prediction studies are carried out to prove predictability enhancement using four prediction techniques and three prediction horizons. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving self-similarity index (i.e., Hurst exponent) in the {PV} production time series and economic viability of the proposed methodology in a particular application.},

However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy generations hinders the reliable operation of microgrids. Besides the commonly adopted methods such as deploying energy storage system ({ESS}) and supplementary fuel generator to address the intermittency issue, energy cooperation among microgrids by enabling their energy exchange for sharing is an appealing new solution. In this paper, we consider the energy management problem for two cooperative microgrids each with individual renewable energy generator and {ESS}. First, by assuming that the microgrids' renewable energy generation/load amounts are perfectly known ahead of time, we solve the off-line energy management problem optimally. Based on the obtained solution, we study the impacts of microgrids' energy cooperation and their {ESSs} on the total energy cost. Next, inspired by the off-line optimization solution, we propose online algorithms for the real-time energy management of the two cooperative microgrids. It is shown via simulations that the proposed online algorithms perform well in practice, have low complexity, and are also valid under arbitrary realizations of renewable energy generations/loads. Finally, we present one method to extend our proposed online algorithms to the general case of more than two microgrids based on a clustering approach.},

It is the first time that the integration of system adequacy and transient stability has been achieved in prospective studies for an electro intensive country, following studies conducted on Reunion Island. The methodology relies on a quantitative assessment of the French power sector‚Äôs reliability through an endogenous definition of a reliability indicator related to kinetic reserves into an Energy System Optimization Model ({ESOM}), {TIMES}-{FR} model. The result gives an overview of how the stability of the grid is maintained with an increasing share of renewables using additional back-up and flexible options. We observe that it is technically possible to achieve around 65\% of Variable Renewable Energy sources ({VREs}) in the installed capacity without impairing the reliability of the system. In more detail, the maximum {VRE} in total hourly power production that complies with the reliability constraint was assessed as around 84\% in the 100 {EnR} scenario. However, in order to guarantee this system reliability, the cumulated new installed capacity, in a scenario with 100\% renewable energy sources ({RES}) in the power mix, would represent the double of the Business-As-Usual ({BAU}) scenario over the period 2013‚Äì2050. Therefore, major upstream planning would be needed, and that more flexible options i.e. demand-response, storage technologies and interconnections or substitute or additional plants should be considered to satisfy the reliability constraint at any time by providing extra inertia to the system. This modelling exercise shows the importance of power exchanges with neighbours with higher share of {RE} in the power production.},

	abstract = {The electricity market in the U.S. is moving toward an energy mix including more variable renewable energy ({VRE}) sources like wind and solar. This increasing {VRE} penetration is altering the profile of the net electricity demand. Traditionally, flexible generators (e.g. gas turbines) are used to absorb fluctuations in the electricity demand. Therefore, an increase in {VRE} also leads to an increase in installed capacity for such flexible generators which, in turn, may increase the price of electricity. Nuclear-Renewable Hybrid Energy Systems (N-R {HES}) are seen as a solution to this problem. The N-R {HES} contains a nuclear power plant electrically and/or thermally linked to an industrial process ({IP}). This paper demonstrates a new methodology and presents the corresponding {RAVEN}/Modelica-based software framework to evaluate the financial performance of N-R {HES}. The novelty of the method is that it explicitly incorporates the stochastic nature of N-R {HES} inputs such as electricity demand and wind speeds. The method is applied to a generic (rather than region-specific) N-R {HES}. The analysis shows that under the right market conditions, economic benefits can be achieved by adding a suitable {IP} to the base-load generator. In particular, there exists an optimal relationship between the {IP} capacity and the demand. Global trends also indicate {VRE} penetration raises the cost of electricity due to the added volatility, an issue only mitigated when operating with high profit margins for the {IP}.},

	abstract = {The existing literature on the construction costs of nuclear power reactors has focused almost exclusively on trends in construction costs in only two countries, the United States and France, and during two decades, the 1970s and 1980s. These analyses, Koomey and Hultman (2007); Grubler (2010), and Escobar-Rangel and L√©v√™que (2015), study only 26\% of reactors built globally between 1960 and 2010, providing an incomplete picture of the economic evolution of nuclear power construction. This study curates historical reactor-specific overnight construction cost ({OCC}) data that broaden the scope of study substantially, covering the full cost history for 349 reactors in the {US}, France, Canada, West Germany, Japan, India, and South Korea, encompassing 58\% of all reactors built globally. We find that trends in costs have varied significantly in magnitude and in structure by era, country, and experience. In contrast to the rapid cost escalation that characterized nuclear construction in the United States, we find evidence of much milder cost escalation in many countries, including absolute cost declines in some countries and specific eras. Our new findings suggest that there is no inherent cost escalation trend associated with nuclear technology.},

Renewable energy sources are not continuous, dependent upon geographical location as well as climatic conditions, and require a very large land footprint. Future of nuclear energy is also uncertain because of public apprehensions and subsequent government policies. To overcome the issues derailing these two virtually carbon-free energy sources, a new hybrid or integrated nuclear-renewable energy system is being proposed and seen as an attractive option. Such integrated energy systems are conceived as a nuclear power reactor coupled with renewable energy generation and industrial processes that may simultaneously tackle the concerns regarding grid flexibility, climate change, energy security, optimal return on invested capital, and settling public concerns. Apart from highlighting the key challenges associated with nuclear energy and renewable energy sources while operating as an independent power generation system, the present paper delineates the various aspects associated with integrated nuclear-renewable energy systems. It may be speculated that integrating nuclear energy and renewable energy into a single hybrid energy system, coupled through informatics linkages, would enable to overcome the demerits present when they operate individual.},

	abstract = {Wind energy has developed rapidly over the last two decades to become one of the most promising and economically viable sources of renewable energy. Although wind energy is claimed to provide clean renewable energy without any emissions during operation, but it is only one side of the coin. The blades, one of the most important components in the wind turbines, made with composite, are currently regarded as unrecyclable. With the first wave of early commercial wind turbine installations now approaching their end of life, the problem of blade disposal is just beginning to emerge as a significant factor for the future. This paper is aimed at discovering the magnitude of the wind turbine blade waste problem, looking not only at disposal but at all stages of a blade‚Äôs lifecycle. The first stage of the research, the subject of this paper, is to accurately estimate present and future wind turbine blade waste inventory using the most recent and most accurate data available. The result will provide a solid reference point to help the industry and policy makers to understand the size of potential environmental problem and to help to manage it better. This study starts by estimating the annual blade material usage with wind energy installed capacity and average blade weight. The effect of other waste contributing factors in the full lifecycle of wind turbine blades is then included, using industrial data from the manufacturing, testing and in-service stages. The research indicates that there will be 43 million tonnes of blade waste worldwide by 2050 with China possessing 40\% of the waste, Europe 25\%, the United States 16\% and the rest of the world 19\%.},

	abstract = {Power systems are the most complex systems and have great importance in modern life. They have direct impacts on the modernization, economic, political and social aspects. To operate such systems in a stable mode, several control and protection techniques are required. However, modern systems are equipped with several protection schemes with the aim of avoiding the unpredicted events and power outages, power systems are still encountering emergency and mal-operation situations. The most severe emergencies put the whole or at least a part of the system in danger. If the emergency is not well managed, the power system is likely to have cascading failures that might lead to a blackout. Due to the consequences, many countries around the world have research and expert teams who work to avoid blackouts on their systems. In this paper, a comprehensive review on the major blackouts and cascading events that have occurred in the last decade are introduced. A particular focus is given on the {US} power system outages and their causes since it is one of the leading power producers in the world and it is also due to the ready availability of data for the past events. The paper also highlights the root causes of different blackouts around the globe. Furthermore, blackout and cascading analysis methods and the consequences of blackouts are surveyed. Moreover, the challenges in the existing protective schemes and research gaps in the topic of power system blackout and cascading events are marked out. Research directions and issues to be considered in future power system blackout studies are also proposed.},

	abstract = {Energy-economy optimization models - encoded with a set of structured, self-consistent assumptions and decision rules - have emerged as a key tool for the analysis of energy and climate policy at the national and international scale. Given the expansive system boundaries and multi-decadal timescales involved, addressing future uncertainty in these models is a critical challenge. The approach taken by many modelers is to build larger models with greater complexity to deal with structural uncertainty, and run a few highly detailed scenarios under different input assumptions to address parametric uncertainty. The result is often large and inflexible models used to conduct analysis that offers little insight. This paper introduces a technique borrowed from the operations research literature called modeling to generate alternatives ({MGA}) as a way to flex energy models and systematically explore the feasible, near-optimal solution space in order to develop alternatives that are maximally different in decision space but perform well with regard to the modeled objectives. The resultant {MGA} alternatives serve a useful role by challenging preconceptions and highlighting plausible alternative futures. A simple, conceptual model of the U.S. electric sector is presented to demonstrate the utility of {MGA} as an energy modeling technique.},

The method relies on the fact that patterns may be too disparate in amplitudes and variances and proceeds by assigning weights for each extracted vector when computing the relative frequencies associated with every motif. Simulations were conducted over synthetic and real data for a weighting scheme inspired by the variance of each pattern. Results show better robustness and stability in the presence of higher levels of noise, in addition to a distinctive ability to extract complexity information from data with spiky features or having abrupt changes in magnitude.},

	abstract = {Successfully predicting the future states of systems that are complex, stochastic, and potentially chaotic is a major challenge. Model forecasting error ({FE}) is the usual measure of success; however model predictions provide no insights into the potential for improvement. In short, the realized predictability of a specific model is uninformative about whether the system is inherently predictable or whether the chosen model is a poor match for the system and our observations thereof. Ideally, model proficiency would be judged with respect to the systems‚Äô intrinsic predictability, the highest achievable predictability given the degree to which system dynamics are the result of deterministic vs. stochastic processes. Intrinsic predictability may be quantified with permutation entropy ({PE}), a model-free, information-theoretic measure of the complexity of a time series. By means of simulations, we show that a correlation exists between estimated {PE} and {FE} and show how stochasticity, process error, and chaotic dynamics affect the relationship. This relationship is verified for a data set of 461 empirical ecological time series. We show how deviations from the expected {PE}‚Äì{FE} relationship are related to covariates of data quality and the nonlinearity of ecological dynamics. These results demonstrate a theoretically grounded basis for a model-free evaluation of a system's intrinsic predictability. Identifying the gap between the intrinsic and realized predictability of time series will enable researchers to understand whether forecasting proficiency is limited by the quality and quantity of their data or the ability of the chosen forecasting model to explain the data. Intrinsic predictability also provides a model-free baseline of forecasting proficiency against which modeling efforts can be evaluated.},

We conjecture that the inherent complexity of real-world time-series data, which results from the dimension, nonlinearity, and nonstationarity of the generating process, as well as from measurement issues such as noise, aggregation, and finite data length, is both empirically quantifiable and directly correlated with predictability. In particular, we argue that redundancy is an effective way to measure complexity and predictive structure in an experimental time series and that weighted permutation entropy is an effective way to estimate that redundancy. To validate these conjectures, we study 120 different time-series data sets. For each time series, we construct predictions using a wide variety of forecast models, then compare the accuracy of the predictions with the permutation entropy of that time series. We use the results to develop a model-free heuristic that can help practitioners recognize when a particular prediction method is not well matched to the task at hand: that is, when the time series has more predictive structure than that method can capture and exploit.},

	abstract = {Climate change and increased urban population are two major concerns for society. Moving towards more sustainable energy solutions in the urban context by integrating renewable energy technologies supports decarbonizing the energy sector and climate change mitigation. A successful transition also needs adequate consideration of climate change including extreme events to ensure the reliable performance of energy systems in the long run. This review provides an overview of and insight into the progress achieved in the energy sector to adapt to climate change, focusing on the climate resilience of urban energy systems. The state-of-the-art methodology to assess impacts of climate change including extreme events and uncertainties on the design and performance of energy systems is described and discussed. Climate resilience is an emerging concept that is increasingly used to represent the durability and stable performance of energy systems against extreme climate events. However, it has not yet been adequately explored and widely used, as its definition has not been clearly articulated and assessment is mostly based on qualitative aspects. This study reveals that a major limitation in the state-of-the-art is the inadequacy of climate change adaptation approaches in designing and preparing urban energy systems to satisfactorily address plausible extreme climate events. Furthermore, the complexity of the climate and energy models and the mismatch between their temporal and spatial resolutions are the major limitations in linking these models. Therefore, few studies have focused on the design and operation of urban energy infrastructure in terms of climate resilience. Considering the occurrence of extreme climate events and increasing demand for implementing climate adaptation strategies, the study highlights the importance of improving energy system models to consider future climate variations including extreme events to identify climate resilient energy transition pathways.},

	abstract = {Humanity must face the reality that it cannot depend indefinitely on combustion of coal, gas and oil for most of its energy needs. In the unavoidable process of gradually replacing fossil fuels, many energy technologies may be considered and most will be deployed in specific applications. However, in the long term, we argue that nuclear fission technology is the only developed energy source that is capable of delivering the enormous quantities of energy that will be needed to run modern industrial societies safely, economically, reliably and in a sustainable way, both environmentally and as regards the available resource base. Consequently, nuclear fission has to play a major role in this necessary transformation of the 21st century energy-supply system. In a first phase of this necessary global energy transformation, the emphasis should be on converting the major part of the world's electrical energy generation capacity from fossil fuels to nuclear fission. This can realistically be achieved within a few decades, as has already been done in France during the 1970s and 1980s. Such an energy transformation would reduce the global emissions of carbon dioxide profoundly, as well as cutting other significant greenhouse gases like methane. Industrial nations should take the lead in this transition. Because methane is a potent greenhouse gas, replacing coal-fired generating stations with gas-fired stations will not necessarily result in a reduction of the rate of greenhouse-gas emission even for relatively low leakage rates of the natural gas into the atmosphere. The energy sources popularly known as ‚Äòrenewables‚Äô (such as wind and solar), will be hard pressed to supply the needed quantities of energy sustainably, economically and reliably. They are inherently intermittent, depending on backup power or on energy storage if they are to be used for delivery of base-load electrical energy to the grid. This backup power has to be flexible and is derived in most cases from combustion of fossil fuels (mainly natural gas). If used in this way, intermittent energy sources do not meet the requirements of sustainability, nor are they economically viable because they require redundant, under-utilized investment in capacity both for generation and for transmission. Intermittent energy installations, in conjunction with gas-fired backup power installations, will in many cases be found to have a combined rate of greenhouse-gas emission that is higher than that of stand-alone coal-fired generating stations of equal generating capacity. A grid connection fee, to be imposed on countries with a large intermittent generating capacity, should be considered for the purpose of compensating adjacent countries for the use of their interconnected electric grids as back-up power. Also, intermittent energy sources tend to negatively affect grid stability, especially as their market penetration rises. The alternative ‚Äî dedicated energy storage for grid-connected intermittent energy sources (instead of backup power) ‚Äî is in many cases not yet economically viable. However, intermittent sources plus storage may be economically competitive for local electricity supply in geographically isolated regions without access to a large electric grid. Yet nuclear fission energy will, even then, be required for the majority displacement of fossil fuels this century.},

The study briefly reviews the materials used by various original equipment manufacturers ({OEM}) for wind turbine blades. Successively, it provides an overview of the various recycling methods with interest in recovered materials, mechanical and physical properties, which are used, for estimating a maximum expected value. All recycling processes show a negative effect on mechanical properties with strength loss between 30\% and 60\%. Process energy demands are reviewed, and considerations are set forward to estimate the minimum cost of operating mechanical, pyrolysis and fluidized bed plants in Germany. Ultimately, current applications of recovered material and related markets are explored. Through interviews and secondary data, it is highlighted that despite the lower mechanical properties, grinded material finds applications in traditional processes, cement kilns and new products. It is also found that pyrolysed fibres can be used as insulation material and oils can be easy to distil. Pyrolysis is a relatively expensive process, thereby, distillation of the oils and energy recovery are necessary enablers towards commercial viability. Mechanically grinded material presents the lowest process cost with ca. ‚Ç¨90/tonne, thus, below landfilling and incineration and falling within the attention of private businesses. Numerous markets are available for recovered materials from wind turbine blades, primarily for grinded products and secondly for pyrolysed glass fibre.},

The goal therefore is a 75 per cent reduction in energy intensity. Four technology-based strategies are investigated, regardless of cost: (i) widespread application of best available technology ({BAT}), (ii)¬†{BAT} to cutting-edge technologies, (iii) aggressive recycling and finally, and (iv) significant improvements in recycling technologies. Taken together, these aggressive strategies could produce impressive gains, of the order of a 50‚Äì56 per cent reduction in energy intensity, but this is still short of our goal of a 75 per cent reduction. Ultimately, we face fundamental thermodynamic as well as practical constraints on our ability to improve the energy intensity of material production.

The methodology is useful to calculate dynamic employment factors (considering technology learning effects) and the specific capacity (based on trade effects) to which these factors should be applied. It is applied to three renewable energy technologies ‚Äì photovoltaics, wind on-shore and wind off-shore- in the European Union Member States in the 2008‚Äì2012 period. The results using this novel methodology broadly confirm the figures provided in other contributions in the literature.

Advocates of nuclear power have reframed the technology as the most reliable, cost-effective and immediate solution to both of these policy problems, and predicted the emergence of a 'nuclear renaissance‚Äô. However, there is little evidence to date that suggests a nuclear renaissance has actually taken place. Public opinion polling demonstrates that many remain unconvinced of the need for nuclear power. This paper uses Cultural Theory as a heuristic to understand why the arguments for a nuclear renaissance have been largely unsuccessful. It argues that the failure of nuclear advocates to engage with a wider cross-section of world-views has prevented the controversy surrounding nuclear power from being resolved, and the nuclear renaissance from becoming a reality. In doing so, this paper builds upon a growing recognition of the contribution that social science research can make to understanding public acceptance of energy policy choices.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis (Temoa), an open source framework for conducting energy system analysis. The core component of Temoa is an energy economy optimization ({EEO}) model, which minimizes the system-wide cost of energy supply by optimizing the deployment and utilization of energy technologies over a user-specified time horizon. The design of Temoa is intended to fill a unique niche within the energy modeling landscape by addressing two critical shortcomings associated with existing models: an inability to perform third party verification of published model results and the difficulty of conducting uncertainty analysis with large, complex models. Temoa leverages a modern revision control system to publicly archive model source code and data, which ensures repeatability of all published modeling work. From its initial conceptualization, Temoa was also designed for operation within a high performance computing environment to enable rigorous uncertainty analysis. We present the algebraic formulation of Temoa and conduct a verification exercise by implementing a simple test system in both Temoa
and {MARKAL}, a widely used commercial model of the same type. In addition, a stochastic optimization of the test system is presented as a proof-of-concept application of uncertainty analysis using the Temoa framework.},

While the number of model-based analyses proliferates, insufficient attention is paid to transparency in model development and application. Given the complex, data-intensive nature of {EEO} models and the general lack of access to source code and data, many of the assumptions underlying model-based analysis are hidden from external observers. This paper discusses the simplifications and subjective judgments involved in the model building process, which cannot be fully articulated in journal papers, reports, or model documentation. In addition, we argue that for all practical purposes, {EEO} model-based insights cannot be validated through comparison to real world outcomes. As a result, modelers are left without credible metrics to assess a model's ability to deliver reliable insight. We assert that {EEO} models should be discoverable through interrogation of publicly available source code and data. In addition, third parties should be able to run a specific model instance in order to independently verify published results. Yet a review of twelve {EEO} models suggests that in most cases, replication of model results is currently impossible. We provide several recommendations to help develop and sustain a software framework for repeatable model analysis.},

	abstract = {Finland and Sweden are the countries with the most advanced plans for final disposal of spent nuclear fuel ({SNF}). Both countries have also been evoked as good examples in the use of a 'partnering' approach, designed to achieve both a licensable site supported by the community and a balance between fair representation and competent participation. While both are consensus-driven high-trust societies, with similar technological concept for {SNF} disposal, and whose licensing processes have advanced at a fairly similar pace, their nuclear waste policies also differ from each other in certain key aspects. One difference concerns the role of the communities in siting and licensing of the repositories. The paper examines 1) the background for this differentiation, 2) how local final disposal organizations in the host communities, Eurajoki and √ñsthammar, took shape and evolved, and 3) how differences between the organizations illustrate the divergence between the Finnish and Swedish approaches to stakeholder engagement. While the Swedish approach can be characterized as 'involved partnership' ‚Äì which shapes the operating environment for the implementer and authorities by challenging and even modifying policies and actions ‚Äì the Finnish case could be described as a 'bystander partnership' characterized by trust in safety authorities, with community economics as the primary concern.},

	abstract = {Stakeholder analysis means many things to different people. Various methods and approaches have been developed in different fields for different purposes, leading to confusion over the concept and practice of stakeholder analysis. This paper asks how and why stakeholder analysis should be conducted for participatory natural resource management research. This is achieved by reviewing the development of stakeholder analysis in business management, development and natural resource management. The normative and instrumental theoretical basis for stakeholder analysis is discussed, and a stakeholder analysis typology is proposed. This consists of methods for: i) identifying stakeholders; ii) differentiating between and categorising stakeholders; and iii) investigating relationships between stakeholders. The range of methods that can be used to carry out each type of analysis is reviewed. These methods and approaches are then illustrated through a series of case studies funded through the Rural Economy and Land Use ({RELU}) programme. These case studies show the wide range of participatory and non-participatory methods that can be used, and discuss some of the challenges and limitations of existing methods for stakeholder analysis. The case studies also propose new tools and combinations of methods that can more effectively identify and categorise stakeholders and help understand their inter-relationships.},

Analysis was conducted for two renewable scenarios designed for the years 2030 and 2050. First scenario, the 50\% renewable energy system, has been created for the year 2030 and represents the first step towards the 100\% renewable energy future of Macedonia. The second scenario has been designed for the 100\% renewable energy system based only on the renewable energy sources ({RES}) in the year 2050. Special attention in the design of these systems has been given to intermittent {RES} and to storage technologies. The analysis reveals that at the moment the 50\% renewable energy system seems much more likely than the 100\% renewable energy system, but with additional energy efficiency measures, which will lead to a decrease of consumption and with installation of new generation capacities this goal can be easily achieved.},

	abstract = {This study presents roadmaps for each of the 50 United States to convert their all-purpose energy systems (for electricity, transportation, heating/cooling, and industry) to ones powered entirely by wind, water, and sunlight ({WWS}). The plans contemplate 80‚Äì85\% of existing energy replaced by 2030 and 100\% replaced by 2050. Conversion would reduce each state's end-use power demand by a mean of ‚àº39.3\% with ‚àº82.4\% of this due to the efficiency of electrification and the rest due to end-use energy efficiency improvements. Year 2050 end-use U.S. all-purpose load would be met with ‚àº30.9\% onshore wind, ‚àº19.1\% offshore wind, ‚àº30.7\% utility-scale photovoltaics ({PV}), ‚àº7.2\% rooftop {PV}, ‚àº7.3\% concentrated solar power ({CSP}) with storage, ‚àº1.25\% geothermal power, ‚àº0.37\% wave power, ‚àº0.14\% tidal power, and ‚àº3.01\% hydroelectric power. Based on a parallel grid integration study, an additional 4.4\% and 7.2\% of power beyond that needed for annual loads would be supplied by {CSP} with storage and solar thermal for heat, respectively, for peaking and grid stability. Over all 50 states, converting would provide ‚àº3.9 million 40-year construction jobs and ‚àº2.0 million 40-year operation jobs for the energy facilities alone, the sum of which would outweigh the ‚àº3.9 million jobs lost in the conventional energy sector. Converting would also eliminate ‚àº62 000 (19 000‚Äì115 000) U.S. air pollution premature mortalities per year today and ‚àº46 000 (12 000‚Äì104 000) in 2050, avoiding ‚àº\$600 (\$85‚Äì\$2400) bil. per year (2013 dollars) in 2050, equivalent to ‚àº3.6 (0.5‚Äì14.3) percent of the 2014 U.S. gross domestic product. Converting would further eliminate ‚àº\$3.3 (1.9‚Äì7.1) tril. per year in 2050 global warming costs to the world due to U.S. emissions. These plans will result in each person in the U.S. in 2050 saving ‚àº\$260 (190‚Äì320) per year in energy costs (\$2013 dollars) and U.S. health and global climate costs per person decreasing by ‚àº\$1500 (210‚Äì6000) per year and ‚àº\$8300 (4700‚Äì17 600) per year, respectively. The new footprint over land required will be ‚àº0.42\% of U.S. land. The spacing area between wind turbines, which can be used for multiple purposes, will be ‚àº1.6\% of U.S. land. Thus, 100\% conversions are technically and economically feasible with little downside. These roadmaps may therefore reduce social and political barriers to implementing clean-energy policies.},

At the core of this task is the switch to 100\% renewables across all sectors on the same time horizon. Conventional technologies fueled by fossil and nuclear energies are, according to the vast majority of current cost calculations, energetically inefficient, too expensive, and too slow in expansion to be able to deliver a substantial contribution to rapid climate protection. We present the first comprehensive energy scenario that shows the way to 100\% renewable energy for all energy sectors by 2030. The result of the calculations is a cost-effective energy system that is compatible with the German share of necessary greenhouse gas reduction. This study shows a target system of generation, conversion, and storage technologies that can achieve the transformation to 100\% renewable energy in all energy sectors‚Äîelectricity, heat, and mobility‚Äîin time and at competitive costs below the costs of the current system. Moreover, we demonstrate the huge cost effect that arises if southern Germany renounces its onshore wind resources and find that this would substantially increase the need for high-voltage direct-current transmission capacity.},

By 2050, not only greenhouse gas emissions have to be eliminated in all energy sectors: power, heat, transport and industry but also these sectors should be closely coupled allowing maximum synergy effects and efficiency. A tool allowing modelling of complex energy system transition for power, heat, transport and industry sectors, responsible for over 75\% of the {CO}2eq emissions, in full hourly resolution, is presented in this research and tested for the case of Kazakhstan. The results show that transition towards a 100\% sustainable and renewable energy based system by 2050 is possible even for the case of severe climate conditions and an energy intensive industry, observed in Kazakhstan. The power sector becomes backbone of the entire energy system, due to more intense electrification induced sector coupling. The results show that electrification and integration of sectors enables additional flexibility, leading to more efficient systems and lower energy supply cost, even though integration effect varies from sector to sector. The levelised cost of electricity can be reduced from 62 ‚Ç¨/{MWh} in 2015 to 46 ‚Ç¨/{MWh} in 2050 in a fully integrated system, while the cost of heat stays on a comparable level within the range of 30‚Äì35 ‚Ç¨/{MWh}, leading to an energy system cost on a level of 40‚Äì45 ‚Ç¨/{MWh}. Transition towards 100\% renewable energy supply shrinks {CO}2eq emissions from these sectors to zero in 2050 with 90\% of the reduction achieved by 2040.},

	abstract = {In order to define a cost optimal 100\% renewable energy system, an hourly resolved model has been created based on linear optimization of energy system parameters under given constrains. The model is comprised of five scenarios for 100\% renewable energy power systems in North-East Asia with different high voltage direct current transmission grid development levels, including industrial gas demand and additional energy security. Renewables can supply enough energy to cover the estimated electricity and gas demands of the area in the year 2030 and deliver more than 2000TWhth of heat on a cost competitive level of 84‚Ç¨/{MWhel} for electricity. Further, this can be accomplished for a synthetic natural gas price at the 2013 Japanese liquefied natural gas import price level and at no additional generation costs for the available heat. The total area system cost could reach 69.4‚Ç¨/{MWhel}, if only the electricity sector is taken into account. In this system about 20\% of the energy is exchanged between the 13 regions, reflecting a rather decentralized character which is supplied 27\% by stored energy. The major storage technologies are batteries for daily storage and power-to-gas for seasonal storage. Prosumers are likely to play a significant role due to favourable economics. A highly resilient energy system with very high energy security standards would increase the electricity cost by 23\% to 85.6‚Ç¨/{MWhel}. The results clearly show that a 100\% renewable energy based system is feasible and lower in cost than nuclear energy and fossil carbon capture and storage alternatives.},

	abstract = {Climate change is defined as the shift in climate patterns mainly caused by greenhouse gas emissions from natural systems and human activities. So far, anthropogenic activities have caused about 1.0¬†¬∞C of global warming above the pre-industrial level and this is likely to reach 1.5¬†¬∞C between 2030 and 2052 if the current emission rates persist. In 2018, the world encountered 315 cases of natural disasters which are mainly related to the climate. Approximately 68.5 million people were affected, and economic losses amounted to \$131.7 billion, of which storms, floods, wildfires and droughts accounted for approximately 93\%. Economic losses attributed to wildfires in 2018 alone are almost equal to the collective losses from wildfires incurred over the past decade, which is quite alarming. Furthermore, food, water, health, ecosystem, human habitat and infrastructure have been identified as the most vulnerable sectors under climate attack. In 2015, the Paris agreement was introduced with the main objective of limiting global temperature increase to 2¬†¬∞C by 2100 and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5¬†¬∞C. This article reviews the main strategies for climate change abatement, namely conventional mitigation, negative emissions and radiative forcing geoengineering. Conventional mitigation technologies focus on reducing fossil-based {CO}2 emissions. Negative emissions technologies are aiming to capture and sequester atmospheric carbon to¬†reduce carbon dioxide levels. Finally, geoengineering techniques of radiative forcing alter the earth‚Äôs radiative energy budget to stabilize or reduce global temperatures. It is evident that conventional mitigation efforts alone are not sufficient to meet the targets stipulated by the Paris agreement; therefore, the utilization of alternative routes appears inevitable. While various technologies presented may still be at an early stage of development, biogenic-based sequestration techniques are to a certain extent mature and can be deployed immediately.},

	abstract = {Electrical energy storage could play an important role in decarbonizing the electricity sector by offering a new, carbon-free source of operational flexibility, improving the utilization of generation assets, and facilitating the integration of variable renewable energy sources. Yet, the future cost of energy storage technologies is uncertain, and the value that they can bring to the system depends on multiple factors. Moreover, the marginal value of storage diminishes as more energy storage capacity is deployed. To explore the potential value of energy storage in deep decarbonization of the electricity sector, we assess the impact of increasing levels of energy storage capacity on both power system operations and investments in generation capacity using a generation capacity expansion model with detailed unit commitment constraints. In a case study of a system with load and renewable resource characteristics from the U.S. state of Texas, we find that energy storage delivers value by increasing the cost-effective penetration of renewable energy, reducing total investments in nuclear power and gas-fired peaking units, and improving the utilization of all installed capacity. However, we find that the value delivered by energy storage with a 2-hour storage capacity only exceeds current technology costs under strict emissions limits, implying that substantial cost reductions in battery storage are needed to justify large-scale deployment. In contrast, storage resources with a 10-hour storage capacity deliver value consistent with the current cost of pumped hydroelectric storage. In general, while energy storage appears essential to enable decarbonization strategies dependent on very high shares of wind and solar energy, storage is not a requisite if a diverse mix of flexible, low-carbon power sources is employed, including flexible nuclear power.},

Nuclear power reduces mitigation costs in all explored scenarios, but the extent varies considerably. Nuclear power reduces costs significantly if carbon storage capacity is low but is replaceable if the capacity is abundant and technology available. The same holds for the cost of renewables. However, providing a full cost benefit analysis of nuclear power is beyond the scope of this paper.},

	abstract = {Seasonal climate variations affect electricity demand, which in turn affects month-to-month electricity planning and operations. Electricity system planning at the monthly timescale can be improved by adapting climate forecasts to estimate electricity demand and utilizing energy models to estimate monthly electricity generation and associated operational costs. The objective of this paper is to develop and test a computationally efficient model that can support seasonal planning while preserving key aspects of system operation over hourly and daily timeframes. To do so, an energy system optimization model is repurposed for seasonal planning using features drawn from a unit commitment model. Different scenarios utilizing a well-known test system are used to evaluate the errors associated with both the repurposed energy system model and an imperfect load forecast. The results show that the energy system optimization model using an imperfect load forecast produces differences in monthly cost and generation levels that are less than 2\% compared with a unit commitment model using a perfect load forecast. The enhanced energy system optimization model can be solved approximately 100 times faster than the unit commitment model, making it a suitable tool for future work aimed at evaluating seasonal electricity generation and demand under uncertainty.},

The model assesses the potential to change grid architecture, fuel mix and grid hardening measures considering hurricane impacts as well as climate mitigation policies. When hurricane trends are included, 2040 electricity cost projections increase by 32\% based on historical hurricane frequencies and by 82\% for increased hurricane frequencies.

First, we identify key criteria for analyzing current {ESMs} and we describe seven current and future low-carbon energy system modeling challenges: the increasing need for flexibility, further electrification, emergence of new technologies, technological learning and efficiency improvements, decentralization, macroeconomic interactions, and the role of social behavior in the energy system transition. These criteria are then translated into required modeling capabilities such as the need for hourly temporal resolution, sectoral coupling technologies (e.g., P2X), technological learning, flexibility technologies, stakeholder behavior, cross border trade, and linking with macroeconomic models. Second, a Multi-Criteria Analysis ({MCA}) is used as a framework to identify modeling gaps while clarifying high modeling capabilities of {MARKAL}, {TIMES}, {REMix}, {PRIMES}, and {METIS}. Third, to bridge major energy modeling gaps, two conceptual modeling suites are suggested, based on both optimization and simulation methodologies, in which the integrated {ESM} is hard-linked with a regional model and an energy market model and soft-linked with a macroeconomic model.,

Understanding features that persist across many cost-efficient alternatives enhances policy advice and acknowledges structural model uncertainties. We apply the modeling-to-generate-alternatives ({MGA}) methodology to systematically explore the near-optimal feasible space of a completely renewable European electricity system model. While accounting for complex spatio-temporal patterns, we allow simultaneous capacity expansion of generation, storage and transmission infrastructure subject to linearized multi-period optimal power flow. Many similarly costly, but technologically diverse solutions exist. Already a cost deviation of 0.5\% offers a large range of possible investments. However, either offshore or onshore wind energy along with some hydrogen storage and transmission network reinforcement appear essential to keep costs within 10\% of the optimum.},

The {MESSAGE} modelling tool was used for modelling and optimisation of the future energy system development. In this study, the introduced approach was applied focussing on small and medium nuclear reactor ({SMR}), which could be one of the future energy source options in Lithuania. As an example of {SMR}, the {IRIS} (International Reactor Innovative and Secure) nuclear reactor was chosen in this study. Finally, the analysis of uncertainty and sensitivity enabled to investigate how uncertain are results of modelling and how this uncertainty is sensitive to the uncertainty of model parameters. In the particular case we have analysed how Lithuanian energy system development scenarios could change, when changing the initial model parameters describing {IRIS} technology. If {IRIS} could be built near the cities without Emergency Planning Zone ({EPZ}) where a big heat demand is, it could be safely used not only for electricity generation, but also for heat supply for residential and industrial consumers.

                  The premise of this Viewpoint article is that the sustainability of the electricity supply is very often addressed in narrow frames of reference, which sets up incremental decision-making. To more fairly compare the economic, social, and environmental aspects of renewables, such as photovoltaics, to fossil fuels, a broader view is required which needs to take into account the impacts of the fossil fuel supply chain.
               
            
            February 2016 was the warmest February since record keeping began in 1880, and was the warmest month in recorded history (in terms of its deviation from average). May 2016, the warmest May on record, was the 13th consecutive record-breaking month. The Paris Agreement signed in December 2015 has solidified agreement that the world must address climate change, and has resounded the warning that inaction on climate change carries potentially catastrophic risk for the global economy. Electricity generated from renewable energy sources is often compared to fossil fuel energy in terms of economics. Recently there have also been increased calls to incorporate the external costs of electricity generation into the price of electricity. Fossil fuels are largely responsible for global warming (as 85\% of the {CO}2 emissions come from fossil fuel combustion). This Viewpoint article looks at fuel supply chains for oil \& gas, coal, and nuclear in terms of their economics, environmental and social consequences. This reflection upon the historical and present fossil fuel supply chain gives a perspective useful in avoiding limited frames of reference when addressing the consequences of the business-as-usual operation of fossil fuel supply chains.},

Nuclear power plant ({NPP}) reactors produce low-level ionizing radiation, high level nuclear waste, and are subject to catastrophic contamination events. Justice concerns include plant locations and the large potentially exposed populations, as well as issues in siting, nuclear safety, and barriers to public participation. Other justice issues relate to extensive contamination in the U.S. nuclear weapons complex, and the mining and processing industries that have supported it. To approach the topic, first we discuss distributional justice issues of {NPP} sites in the U.S. and related procedural injustices in siting, operation, and emergency preparedness. Then we discuss justice concerns involving the U.S. nuclear weapons complex and the ways that uranium mining, processing, and weapons development have affected those living downwind, including a substantial American Indian population. Next we examine the problem of high-level nuclear waste and the risk implications of the lack of secure long-term storage. The handling and deposition of toxic nuclear wastes pose new transgenerational justice issues of unprecedented duration, in comparison to any other industry. Finally, we discuss the persistent risks of nuclear technologies and renewable energy alternatives.},

However, a holistic framework for assessing such complex climate change risks has not yet been achieved. Clarity is needed regarding the interactions that generate risk, including the role of adaptation and mitigation responses. In this perspective, we present a framework for three categories of increasingly complex climate change risk that focus on interactions among the multiple drivers of risk, as well as among multiple risks. A significant innovation is recognizing that risks can arise both from potential impacts due to climate change and from responses to climate change. This approach encourages thinking that traverses sectoral and regional boundaries and links physical and socio-economic drivers of risk. Advancing climate change risk assessment in these ways is essential for more informed decision making that reduces negative climate change impacts.},

In planning, this change is reflected by applying optimization models to regions within a country to optimize the distribution of generation units and to evaluate the resulting impact on the grid topology. This paper proposes a globally applicable framework to find a suitable regionalization for energy system models with a data-driven approach. Based on a global, spatially resolved database of demand, generation, and renewable profiles, hierarchical clustering with fine-tuning is performed. This regionalization approach is applied by modeling the resulting regions in an optimization model including a synthesized grid. In an exemplary case study, South Africa‚Äôs energy system is examined. The results show that the data-driven regionalization is beneficial compared to the common approach of using political regions. Furthermore, the results of a modeled 80\% decarbonization until 2045 demonstrate that the integration of renewable energy sources fundamentally changes the role of regions within South Africa‚Äôs energy system. Thereby, the electricity exchange between regions is also impacted, leading to a different grid topology. Using clustered regions improves the understanding and analysis of regional transformations in the decarbonization process.},

	abstract = {Cities are not only major contributors to global climate change but also stand at the forefront of climate change impact. Quantifying and assessing the risk potentially induced by climate change has great significance for cities to undertake positive climate adaptation and risk prevention. However, most of the previous studies focus on global, national or regional dimensions, only a few have attempted to examine climate change risk at an urban scale and even less in the case of a recent literature review. As a result, a quantitative assessment of climate change risk for cities remains highly challenging. To fill this gap, the article makes a critical review of the recent literature on urban-scale climate change risk assessment, and classifies them into four major categories of studies which jointly constitute a stepwise modelling chain from global climate change towards urban-scale risk assessment. On this basis, the study summarizes the updated research progresses and discusses the major challenges to be overcome for the seamless coupling of climate simulation between different scales, the reproduction of compound climate events, the incorporation of non-market and long-lasting impacts and the representation of risk transmission insides or beyond a city. Furthermore, future directions to advance quantitative assessment of urban-scale climate change risk are highlighted, with fresh insights into improving study methodology, enriching knowledge of climate change impact on city, enhancing abundance and accessibility to data, and exploring the best practice to provide city-specific climate risk service.},

These changes necessitate considerable modifications of the energy infrastructure. Even though most of these modifications are inherently motivated by geospatial questions and challenges, the integration of energy system models and Geographic Information Systems ({GIS}) is still in its infancy. This paper analyzes the shortcomings of previous approaches in using {GIS} in renewable energy-related projects, extracts distinct challenges from these previous efforts and, finally, defines a set of core future research avenues for {GIS}-based energy infrastructure planning with a focus on the use of renewable energy. These future research avenues comprise the availability base data and their ‚Äúgeospatial awareness‚Äù, the development of a generic and unified data model, the usage of volunteered geographic information ({VGI}) and crowdsourced data in analysis processes, the integration of 3D building models and 3D data analysis, the incorporation of network topologies into {GIS}, the harmonization of the heterogeneous views on aggregation issues in the fields of energy and {GIS}, fine-grained energy demand estimation from freely-available data sources, decentralized storage facility planning, the investigation of {GIS}-based public participation mechanisms, the transition from purely structural to operational planning, data privacy aspects and, finally, the development of a new dynamic power market design.},

	abstract = {One major avenue for policymakers to meet climate targets is by decarbonizing the power sector, one component of which is raising the share of renewable energy sources (renewables) in electricity generation. However, promoting renewables --in liberalized power markets-- creates a paradox in that successful penetration of renewables could fall victim to its own success. With the current market architecture, future deployment of renewable energy will necessarily be more costly and less scalable. Moreover, transition towards a full 100\% renewable electricity sector is unattainable. Paradoxically, in order for renewable technologies to continue growing their market share, they need to co-exist with fossil fuel technologies. Ignoring these findings can slow adoption and increase the costs of deploying new renewable technologies. This paper spots the incompatibility between electricity liberalization and renewable policy, regardless of the country, location or renewable technologies. The Paradox holds as long as market clear prices with short term marginal costs, and renewable technology's marginal cost is close to zero and not dispatchable.},

The optimization of the different energy sources is a multi-objective optimization problem because it concerns economical, technical and environmental aspects. The aim of this study is to present the model {EPLANopt}, developed by Eurac Research, which couples the deterministic simulation model {EnergyPLAN} developed by Aalborg University with a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm built on the Python library {DEAP}. The test case is the energy system of South Tyrol, for which results obtained through this methodology are presented. Particular attention is devoted to the analysis of energy efficiency in buildings. A curve representing the marginal costs of the different energy efficiency strategies versus the annual energy saving is applied to the model through an external Python script.

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the behavior of a day-ahead ({DA}) retail electrical energy market with price-based demand response from air conditioning ({AC}) loads through a hierarchical multiagent framework, employing a machine learning approach. At the top level of the hierarchy, a retailer agent buys energy from the {DA} wholesale market and sells it to the consumers. The goal of the retailer agent is to maximize its profit by setting the optimal retail prices, considering the response of the price-sensitive loads. Upon receiving the retail prices, at the lower level of the hierarchy, the {AC} agents employ a Q-learning algorithm to optimize their consumption patterns through modifying the temperature set-points of the devices, considering both consumption costs and users' comfort preferences. Since the retailer agent does not have direct access to the {AC} loads' underlying dynamics and decision process (i.e., incomplete information) the data privacy of the consumers becomes a source of uncertainty in the retailer's decision model. The retailer relies on techniques from the field of machine learning to develop a reliable model of the aggregate behavior of the price-sensitive loads to reduce the uncertainty of the decision-making process. Hence, a multiagent framework based on machine learning enables us to address issues such as interoperability and decision-making under incomplete information in a system that maintains the data privacy of the consumers. We will show that using the proposed model, all the agents are able to optimize their behavior simultaneously. Simulation results show that the proposed approach leads to a reduction in overall power consumption cost as the system converges to its equilibrium. This also coincides with maximization in the retailer's profit. We will also show that the same decision architecture can be used to reduce peak load to defer/avoid distribution system upgrades under high penetration of photo-voltaic power in the distribution feeder.},

Solar photovoltaic, wind turbine, solar heat collector, heat pump, heat storage, battery, and as a novelty, heat insulation thickness are considered. Backup power is either drawn from the grid or produced by a diesel generator in grid-connected and off-grid scenarios, respectively.},

A {rNPP} is a {NPP} intentionally designed, sited, interfaced, and operated in a manner to enhance Grid resilience. Four specific {rNPP} applications are discussed: (1) {rNPPs} as ‚Äúflexible operations‚Äù electricity generation assets, (2) {rNPPs} as anchors of nuclear hybrid energy systems, (3) {rNPPs} as Grid Black Start Resources, and (4) {rNPPs} as anchors of Resilient Critical Infrastructure Islands. These four applications, individually and collectively, could enhance U.S. Grid, Critical Infrastructure, and societal resilience during normal conditions and in the wake of major national calamities stemming from natural hazards and/or malevolent human actions. {rNPPs} would be both tactical and strategic resilience assets, thereby extending the value proposition of nuclear energy well beyond that associated with nuclear power‚Äôs traditional baseload electricity generation. These are important topics as society grows increasingly dependent on electricity, and the natural hazard and malevolent human threat portfolio to the Grid continues to evolve.},

	abstract = {Introducing large amounts of electricity produced from variable renewable energy sources such as wind and solar decreases wholesale electricity price while increasing the volatility of the market. These conditions drive the need for peak-load power generation, while regulation requirements fuel the push for flexible power generation. The increase of variable renewable energy in the market share, along with falling natural gas prices, makes nuclear power plants less competitive. Thermal storage is being considered to increase the nuclear power plant revenue. Thermal storage increases the flexibility of the nuclear plant system without sacrificing its efficiency. There are multiple opportunities to increase the nuclear power plant revenue, including increased capacity payments, arbitrage, and ancillary services. An economic analysis was performed to investigate the revenue increase of the system with thermal storage. The investment cost was assessed, and net present value was evaluated for the considered scenarios. Two system designs were considered in the analysis: a thermal storage system using the existing power conversion infrastructure and an integrated design with thermal storage fully incorporated into the reactor system design. The preliminary analysis showed that introducing a thermal storage system is profitable for some scenarios considered. Profitability depends significantly on the storage size, output flexibility, share of variable renewable energy, and market characteristics.},

	abstract = {A distributed energy resource ({DER}) system, which can be defined as a medium or small energy conversion and utilization system with various functions for meeting multiple targets, is directly oriented towards users and achieves on-site production and energy supply according to users‚Äô demands. Optimization research on system construction has recently become an important issue. In this paper, simple stochastic mathematical equations were used to interpret the optimal design problem of a {DER} system, and based on this, a novel method for solving the optimization problem, which has multi-dimensional stochastic uncertainties (involving the price of input-energy and energy supply and demand), was put forward. A mixed-integer linear programming ({MILP}) model was established for the optimal design of the {DER} system by combining the ideas of mean value and variance, aiming to minimize the total costs, including facility costs, energy purchase costs, and loss caused by energy supply shortage, and considering the energy balance and facility performance constraints. In the end, a {DER} system design for an office building district in Xuzhou, China, was taken as an example to verify the model. The influences of uncertainty on the selection of system facilities and the economic evaluation were analyzed. The result indicated that uncertainty of energy demand played a significant role in optimal design, whereas energy price played a negligible role. With respect to economy, if uncertainties are not considered in system design, it will result in a short supply, and therefore the total cost will increase considerably. The calculation convergence was compared with previous work. The implementation results showed the practicality and efficiency of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {The objective of the paper is to study the potential behaviour of a power system with high share of nuclear and less thermal plants, in which variable {RES} insertion increases ‚àí for example the French case ‚àí, in order to determine the specifications for the design of a potential nuclear reactor with high ‚Äúmanoeuvrability‚Äù. Moreover, the flexible reactor may participate more in the supply ‚àí demand balance and in particular during large frequency fluctuations caused by the high variability of {RES}. The studies are carried out with the {PowerFactory} software, which make it possible to highlight specific needs regarding the power ramp for an ‚Äúideal‚Äù flexible nuclear reactor. Using a benchmark network, the Kundur ‚Äú2 areas-4 machines‚Äù, the flexibility requirements are obtained as a function of the grid disturbances. For this purpose, the penetration of variable {RES} is progressively increased, while nuclear power is reduced and thermal power plants are totally suppressed. The study shows that a drop in {RES} production directly impacts the minimal frequency. A faster response speed of nuclear power makes it possible to restore this stability and return to normal operating conditions imposed by the grid operator. This paper describes therefore the process of obtaining the flexibility criterion for different cases of insertion of variable {RES}.},

	abstract = {There is a growing sociopolitical desire to develop cleaner energy sources in the United States and maintain energy security. Regardless of politics, many coal-fired electric plants have already been shut down and many utilities are vowing to retire their current coal-fired assets within the next two decades. Replacement power assets require consideration of appropriate siting. A geographic information system ({GIS})-based multicriteria decision analysis approach is useful to assist utility and energy companies, as well as policymakers, to evaluate potential areas for siting new plants in the contiguous United States. A {GIS}-based framework is simply a database of location information that allows for mapping, querying, modeling, and analyzing data based on location. The spatial output can be structured to be visual, allowing for easier analysis of location data. The need to site additional power assets, including renewable resources and clean power sources, such as nuclear, led to the development of the Oak Ridge Siting Analysis for power Generation Expansion ({OR}-{SAGE}) tool discussed in this paper. The tool takes inputs such as population growth, water availability, environmental indicators, and tec¬≠ tonic and geological hazards to provide an in-depth visual analysis for siting options. Energy companies and other stakeholders can use {OR}-{SAGE} to procure feedback quickly and effectively on land suitability based on technology specific inputs. Policymakers can use {OR}-{SAGE} to analyze the impacts of future energy technology decisions, while balancing competing resource use. This paper discusses the recent use of {OR}-{SAGE} for these purposes and plans for future development.},

From this material, it analyzes such visions based on rhetorical features such as common problems and functions, storylines, discursive struggles, and rhetorical effectiveness. It also analyzes visions based on typologies or degrees of valence (utopian vs. dystopian), temporality (proximal vs. distant), and radicalism (incremental vs. transformative). The article is motivated by the premise that tackling climate change via low-carbon energy systems (and practices) is one of the most significant challenges of the twenty-first century, and that effective decarbonization will require not only new energy technologies, but also new ways of understanding language, visions, and discursive politics surrounding emerging innovations and transitions.},

Firstly, it adds investment models into the review which have not been previously reviewed for decentralized energy modeling. Secondly, a modeling framework consisting of four building blocks is proposed that covers model conceptualization and model operationalization. Thirdly, the relationship between trading mechanisms and model methods is revealed using four evaluation criteria. Furthermore, by reviewing the papers, several trends in the literature are found. Operational models and local markets have been extensively studied, while wholesale market integration and investment models lack scientific attention. Among different trading mechanisms, the usage of bilateral contracts is most commonly seen. Lastly, optimization models significantly outnumber other model methods, and then it follows that their pitfalls such as the scalability of the model and the existence of stable outcomes need to be further addressed in future research.},

As a result, there has been a proliferation of concepts in the scientific literature, such as community energy, energy communities, community solar, and community wind. However, what scholars mean by ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù in these contexts is often unclear and inconsistent. This paper provides further conceptual clarity in the field by analyzing how the term of community is conceptualized in the scholarly literature on energy systems, through a systematic review of 405 articles. We combine an author keyword network analysis of this corpus with an in-depth analysis of 183 definitions extracted from these articles and systematically coded across three dimensions: meanings, activities and objectives of communities. Our findings show that the meanings attached to the notion of community and the alleged objectives pursued by communities vary substantially across concepts and over time. In particular, there has been a shift away from a notion of community understood as a process that emphasizes participatory aspects toward a notion of com¬≠ munity primarily referring to a place. Furthermore, there is a growing focus on communities‚Äô economic objec¬≠ tives rather than their social or political goals. These findings suggest a weakening of scholars‚Äô attention to ‚Äútransformative‚Äù notions of community emphasizing collective and grassroots processes of participation in en¬≠ ergy transitions, to the benefit of ‚Äúinstrumental‚Äù notions. This trend runs the risk of placing the sole emphasis on the market value of communities, thereby diluting their distinctiveness from more commercial actors.},

In contrast to approaches that pursue political consensus this article argues that such disagreement is not a matter of a clash with ignorant or immoral perspectives, but should rather be understood as irreducible political conflict that plays a valuable role in engendering social and technological transformation. Focusing particularly upon the contestation over nuclear energy, it challenges eco-modernist claims that technological innovation can bypass political disagreement and smoothly facilitate the shift to a more sustainable form of life in an era of ecological crisis. The article advocates an ‚Äúecological agonistic‚Äù approach that refuses to regard such contestation as an impediment to robust and radical transformation. Instead, it suggests that the conflicts over nuclear energy reveal the limitations and lacunae of existing social, economic, and political institutions and thus can be understood as themselves playing a salutary role in their transformation.},

This paper introduces the Electricity Markets and Investment Suite - Agent-Based Simulation ({EMIS}-{AS}), which models the evolution of the electricity generation mix under various market structures while explicitly capturing the aforementioned investment factors and imperfect information. {EMISAS} advances the state-of-the-art of generation expansion planning and agent-based modeling by incorporating various aspects of investor heterogeneity (e.g., differences in financial characteristics, technology preferences, and attitudes towards risk under uncertainty), a robust price prediction methodology, a methodology for updating investors‚Äô forecast parameters using Kalman Filters, and endogenous representation of a customizable set of wholesale electricity markets including energy, ancillary services, capacity, and renewable energy certificate markets. Implementation of {EMIS}-{AS} on a test system highlights the strong role that firms‚Äô heterogeneous attributes have on the investment decisions, generation portfolio, and resulting resource adequacy. In multiple instances, investment and retirement results diverge not only due to each firm‚Äôs own parameters, but also due to the actions and characteristics of other firms. Results also demonstrate how imperfect information and risk preferences can lead to suboptimal investment outcomes, which can require firm-level recourse actions with severe profitability implications. In addition, a comparison with a traditional generation expansion planning model highlights the ability of {EMIS}-{AS} to capture resource scarcity and early retirements caused by real-world imperfections that traditional models cannot represent.},

However, their deployment has moral implications, for example regarding data privacy, user autonomy, or distribution of responsibilities. ‚ÄòEnergy justice‚Äô is one of the most comprehensive frameworks to address these implications, but remains limited regarding smart grids, and regarding concrete guidelines for designers and policymakers. In this paper, we fill this gap by answering the following research question: How do design choices in smart grid projects impact energy justice? Thereby, four smart grid pilot projects are evaluated in a comparative qualitative case study research design. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and a content analysis. Our findings contribute to the energy justice literature with insights regarding the design for distributive, recognition, and procedural justice. They underscore the importance of fairness in data governance, participatory design, user control and autonomy, technology inclusiveness, and the design for expansion and replication. Future research should explore the feasibility to govern smart grids as commons and the relationship between trust and perceptions of justice. We conclude with policy recommendations for funding future smart grid experiments and for facilitating the implementation of storage through electricity sector regulation.},

Despite some efforts in unifying different types of mono-objective evolutionary and non-{EAs}, researchers are not interested enough in unifying all three types of optimization problems together. Such a unified algorithm will allow users to work with a single software enabling one-time implementation of solution representation, operators, objectives, and constraints formulations across several objective dimensions. For the first time, we propose a unified evolutionary optimization algorithm for solving all three classes of problems specified above, based on the recently proposed elitist, guided nondominated sorting procedure, developed for solving many-objectives problems. Using a new niching-based selection procedure, our proposed unified algorithm automatically degenerates to an efficient equivalent population-based algorithm for each class. No extra parameters are needed. Extensive simulations are performed on unconstrained and constrained test problems having single-, two-, multi-, and many-objectives and on two engineering optimization design problems. Performance of the unified approach is compared to suitable population-based counterparts at each dimensional level. Results amply demonstrate the merit of our proposed unified approach and motivate similar studies for a richer understanding of the development of optimization algorithms.},

	abstract = {Low-carbon transitions are often assumed as positive phenomena, because they supposedly reduce carbon emissions, yet without vigilance, there is evidence that they can in fact create new injustices and vulnerabilities, while also failing to address pre-existing structural drivers of injustice in energy markets and the wider socio-economy. With this in mind, we examine four European low-carbon transitions from an unusual normative perspective: that of energy justice. Because a multitude of studies looks at the co-benefits of¬†renewable energy, low-carbon mobility, or climate change mitigation, we instead ask in this paper what are the types of injustices associated with low-carbon transitions? Relatedly, in what ways do low-carbon transitions worsen social risks or vulnerabilities? Lastly, what policies might be deployed to make these transitions more just? We answer these questions by first elaborating an ‚Äúenergy justice‚Äù framework consisting of four distinct dimensions‚Äîdistributive justice (costs and benefits), procedural justice (due process), cosmopolitan justice (global externalities), and recognition justice (vulnerable groups). We then examine four European low-carbon transitions‚Äînuclear power in France, smart meters in Great Britain, electric vehicles in Norway, and solar energy in Germany‚Äîthrough this critical justice lens. In doing so, we draw from original data collected from 64 semi-structured interviews with expert participants¬†as well as five public focus groups and the monitoring of twelve large¬†internet forums. We document 120 distinct energy injustices across these four transitions, including 19 commonly recurring injustices. We aim to show how when low-carbon transitions unfold, deeper injustices related to equity, distribution, and fairness invariably arise.},

	abstract = {Models for supporting climate adaptation and mitigation planning, mostly in the form of Integrated Assessment Models, are poorly equipped for aiding questions related to fairness of adaptation and mitigation strategies, because they often disregard distributional outcomes. When evaluating policies using such models, the costs and benefits are typically aggregated across all actors in the system, and over the entire planning horizon. While a policy may be beneficial when considering the aggregate outcome, it can be harmful to some people, somewhere, at some point in time. The practice of aggregating over all actors and over time thus gives rise to problems of justice; it could also exacerbate existing injustices. While the literature discusses some of these injustices in ad-hoc and case specific manner, a systematic approach for considering distributive justice in model-based climate change planning is lacking. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing 11 requirements that an Integrated Assessment Model should meet in order to enable the assessment of distributive justice in climate mitigation and adaptation policies. We derive the requirements from various ethical imperatives stemming from the theory of distributive justice. More specifically, we consider both intra-generational (among people within one generation) and intergenerational (between generations) distributive justice. We investigate to what extent the 11 requirements are being met in recent model-based climate planning studies, and highlight several directions for future research to advance the accounting for distributive justice in model-based support for climate change planning.

The aim is firstly to review the current state of the art in the energy justice literature and, secondly, to present findings that support novel recommendations with the potential to enhance the impact of energy justice research, including applications in the economic and planning policy sectors. Critically, our study demonstrates that the literature lacks diversity in its author basis and research design. By contrast, conceptual frameworks and the geographies and technologies of global energy injustice are proliferating. These results illustrate that energy justice has power and agency as a tool. It can act as a protagonist in energy research, provoking researchers to remain reflexively normative and active in identifying injustices and vulnerabilities, and it can act as a promising progenitor, creating new research methods and themes.},

Cities are promising leverage points to facilitate system transitions by promoting local innovation and policy experimentation. Building on transition management, we developed a knowledge base for the imple¬≠ mentation of transition experiments to reduce city-level car use. From screening nearly 800 peer-reviewed studies and case studies, including in-depth analysis of 24 documents that met quality criteria and quantita¬≠ tively estimated car use reduction, we identify 12 intervention types combining different measures and policy instruments that were effective in reducing car use in European cities. The most effective at reducing overall car use were the Congestion Charge, Parking \& Traffic Congrol, and Limited Traffic Zone. Most interventions were led by local government, planned and decided in collaboration with different urban stakeholders. We evaluated the potential of the identified intervention types to be implemented in a pilot study of Lund, Sweden, using three criteria from Transition Management of novelty, feasibility, and suitability, as assessed by interviews with local experts. We recommend three transition experiments to reduce local car use in Lund: Parking and Traffic Control, Workplace Parking Charge, and Mobility Services for Commuters. We suggest practitioners follow our method to identify effective and locally suitable interventions to reduce car use, and future research quantify the effec¬≠ tiveness of interventions to reduce car use using the standardised outcome measure of daily passenger kilometres travelled by car.},

	abstract = {The optimal design of off-grid microgrids in developing countries is difficult to achieve, as several political and socio-economic risks can hamper investments of private companies. Estimating the energy demand and its growth is a challenging task, subject to high uncertainty that rarely have been accounted for in multi-year simulations at hourly resolution. Besides, from a long-term perspective, the assets degradation can signifi¬≠ cantly affect the performance of stand-alone hybrid energy systems. In this paper, we address these challenges and propose a novel stochastic dynamic method to size microgrids, simulating with accuracy the system oper¬≠ ation and considering the unavoidable uncertainty in load growth and the components ageing. A predefined scenario tree structure allows capturing the load growth uncertainty and obtaining different capacity expansion strategies for each scenario. An illustrative case study for an isolated power system in Kenya using data collected in 23 Kenyan microgrids is shown. The proposed stochastic formulation results in a considerable reduction of the size of components with respect to traditional single-year approaches. Savings in terms of Net Present Cost ({NPC}) are beyond 16-20\% and the effects of assets degradation are about 6\%. Results lead to recommend multi-year optimization tools, as single-year methodologies can hardly achieve the same performances.},

The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm ({NSGA}-{II}) provides a decision support mechanism in solving multi-objective problems and providing a set of non-dominated solutions where finding an absolute optimum solution is not possible. The present study uses {NSGA}-{II} algorithm in the design of a standalone {HRES} comprising wind turbine, {PV} panel and battery bank with the (economic) objective of minimum system total cost and (performance) objective of maximum reliability. To address the uncertainties in renewable resources (wind speed and solar irradiance), an innovative method is proposed which is based on Chance Constrained Programming ({CCP}). A case study is used to validate the proposed method, where the results obtained are compared with the conventional method of incorporating uncertainties using Monte Carlo simulation.},

	abstract = {The overall evaluation of small autonomous hybrid power systems ({SAHPS}) that contain renewable and conventional power sources depends on economic and environmental criteria, which are often conÔ¨Çicting objectives. The solution of this problem belongs to the Ô¨Åeld of non-linear combinatorial multiobjective optimisation. In a multiobjective optimisation problem, the target is not to Ô¨Ånd an optimal solution, but a set of non-dominated solutions called Pareto-set. The present article considers as an economic objective the minimisation of system‚Äôs cost of energy ({COE}), whereas the environmental objective is the minimisation of the total greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions of the system during its lifetime. The main novelty of this article is that the calculation of {GHG} emissions is based on life cycle analysis ({LCA}) of each system‚Äôs component. In {LCA}, the whole life cycle emissions of a component are taken into account, from raw materials extraction to Ô¨Ånal disposal/recycling. This article adopts the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm ({NSGA}-{II}), which in combination with a proposed local search procedure effectively solves the multiobjective optimisation problem of {SAHPS}. Two main categories of {SAHPS} are examined with different energy storage: lead-acid batteries and hydrogen storage. The results indicate the superiority of batteries under both economic and environmental criteria.},

To provide guidance for a regional market design in China, this study develops an optimization model to simulate the power system operation results of an integrated regional market, and compares the actual operating costs with the optimized costs to obtain economic benefits from market integration. Three allocation mechanisms are designed to allocate the benefits. The market integration of China Southern Grid region in 2017 is employed as a case study and the major conclusions achieved are that: (1) The total economic gains from electricity market integration are {US}\$ 5.34 billion, representing 16\% of the actual operational cost in the China Southern Grid region. (2) Hydropower generation has the greatest impact on the integration benefits, while the capacity of cross-border transmission lines has the least impact. (3) The results of benefits allocation under the mechanisms of Equal share, Shapley value and Raiffa value vary substantially, and a good balance of the equity and feasibility is needed in designing the benefits allocation mechanisms. These obtained results confirm the fact that market integration will contribute to larger benefits with a fair allocation mechanism, thus deserving to be implemented during the current round of electricity market reform in China.},

The development of energy supply networks is strongly correlated with the economics of energy sources as well as ecological and socio-political issues. However, the energy supply network is often distant from the social perspective. This paper therefore combines examination of perceptions and awareness of general public (web-based questionnaire) and top energy experts (a Delphi survey) on the energy supply network and identifies their potential integration in energy supply decision making processes. The results showed that public should be better informed as well as integrated into designing energy supply network as the prosumers gain power and the energy suppliers will no longer dominate the market. Public actors are ready to shape sustainable energy supply and also willing to pay 5.8\% more for a sustainable energy supply. The majority are prepared to invest in renewable energy supply network close to their place of residence. Another result is that the public is calling for a shift in priority towards more sustainable and socially friendlier energy supply rather than focusing mainly on the economic and technical perspectives.},

	abstract = {Energy justice is now an established research topic in the field of energy policy. Despite the growing popularity of energy justice research, however, conceptual and analytical frameworks used in the field have remained limited. This paper reviews the prevailing three-tenet framework of energy justice which has shaped the current discourse based on the three dimensions‚Äîdistributional, procedural, and recognition justice. As an effort to contribute to expanding the research agenda of energy justice problems, we propose a new understanding of the production of energy injustice by characterizing three institutionalized tendencies of dominant modern energy systems: (1) preference for large-scale technical systems and distancing of system designs from local decision-making processes, (2) centralization of energy production and concomitant distancing of supply from users, and (3) widespread ‚Äòrisk-taking‚Äô tendencies portrayed by designers and proponents of current energy supply systems as a necessary ‚Äòprice to pay‚Äô for technological innovation and social progress. We then connect these three tendencies to political, economic, and technical ideologies of modernism that often provide justifications for energy inequity: (1) top-down political and economic decision-making systems, (2) technical interpretation of sustainability, (3) specialist understanding of fairness, and (4) path dependency in the modern energy paradigm. Finally, we present an illustration of how this new conception of systemic energy injustice can be applied in practice using the case of South Korea's nuclear power system and Seoul's One Less Nuclear Power Plant Initiative.},

Since optimization is an inherent part of these research fields, more optimization related frameworks have arisen in the past few years. Only a few of them support optimization of multiple conflicting objectives at a time, but do not provide comprehensive tools for a complete multi-objective optimization task. To address this issue, we have developed pymoo, a multi-objective optimization framework in Python. We provide a guide to getting started with our framework by demonstrating the implementation of an exemplary constrained multi-objective optimization scenario. Moreover, we give a high-level overview of the architecture of pymoo to show its capabilities followed by an explanation of each module and its corresponding sub-modules. The implementations in our framework are customizable and algorithms can be modified/extended by supplying custom operators. Moreover, a variety of single, multi- and many-objective test problems are provided and gradients can be retrieved by automatic differentiation out of the box. Also, pymoo addresses practical needs, such as the parallelization of function evaluations, methods to visualize low and high-dimensional spaces, and tools for multi-criteria decision making.

These small power systems typically host a hybrid energy system of diverse architecture and size. An effective integration of renewable energies resources requires careful design. Sizing methodologies often lack the consideration for reliability and this aspect is limited to power adequacy. There exists an inherent trade-off between renewable integration, cost, and reliability. To bridge this gap, a sizing methodology has been developed to perform multi-objective optimization, considering the three design objectives mentioned above. This method is based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm ({NSGA}-{II}) that returns the set of optimal solutions under all objectives. This method aims to identify the trade-offs between renewable integration, reliability, and cost allowing to choose the adequate architecture and sizing accordingly. As a case study, we consider an autonomous microgrid, currently being installed in a rural area in Mali. The results show that increasing system reliability can be done at the least cost if carried out in the initial design stage.},

	abstract = {The Paris Agreement does not only stipulate to limit the global average temperature increase to well below 2 ¬∞C, it also calls for ‚Äòmaking finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions‚Äô. Consequently, there is an urgent need to understand the implications of climate targets for energy systems and quantify the associated investment requirements in the coming decade. A meaningful analysis must however consider the near-term mitigation requirements to avoid the overshoot of a temperature goal. It must also include the recently observed fast technological progress in key mitigation options. Here, we use a new and unique scenario ensemble that limit peak warming by construction and that stems from seven up-to-date integrated assessment models. This allows us to study the near-term implications of different limits to peak temperature increase under a consistent and up-to-date set of assumptions. We find that ambitious immediate action allows for limiting median warming outcomes to well below 2 ¬∞C in all models. By contrast, current nationally determined contributions for 2030 would add around 0.2 ¬∞C of peak warming, leading to an unavoidable transgression of 1.5 ¬∞C in all models, and 2 ¬∞C in some. In contrast to the incremental changes as foreseen by current plans, ambitious peak warming targets require decisive emission cuts until 2030, with the most substantial contribution to decarbonization coming from the power sector. Therefore, investments into low-carbon power generation need to increase beyond current levels to meet the Paris goals, especially for solar and wind technologies and related system enhancements for electricity transmission, distribution and storage. Estimates on absolute investment levels, up-scaling of other low-carbon power generation technologies and investment shares in less ambitious scenarios vary considerably across models. In scenarios limiting peak warming to below 2 ¬∞C, while coal is phased out quickly, oil and gas are still being used significantly until 2030, albeit at lower than current levels. This requires continued investments into existing oil and gas infrastructure, but investments into new fields in such scenarios might not be needed. The results show that credible and effective policy action is essential for ensuring efficient allocation of investments aligned with medium-term climate targets.},

The study identified 261 plans and initiatives in the 50 cities during the 2010‚Äì2020 period that had connections between social equity and sustainability. Results indicate that cities still have many opportunities to improve plans and initiatives when undertaking revisions. To that end, 21 types of goals and initiatives are identified from the data set to show a composite picture of how cities can integrate social equity with sustainability in this area. Of the 21 types, only 7 appeared in more than 50\% of the cities. The study also provides an analysis of opportunities for robust engagement, implementation, equity tracking, and connections of goals across sectors. An additional analysis shows that cities with greater attention to the sustainability-equity nexus tend to lean toward the center-left Democratic Party, to have higher education and income, and to have sustainability offices.},

	abstract = {Recent academic evidence suggests that, in contrast to what is often thought, the introduction of renewable energy infrastructures often leads to negative, not positive, social equity outcomes. Against this background, this paper aims to develop and empirically illustrate an integrative framework for analysing the work ‚Äì or ‚Äòagency‚Äô ‚Äì exercised by actors operating within and across different global contexts to align renewable energy and social equity. To this end, the paper first reviews three generative conceptions of agency in the energy transitions literature: institutional work, imaginaries and energy justice. In reviewing their explanatory power as well as their shortcomings, the paper concludes that these different conceptions of agency can be integrated meaningfully in an expanded conceptualisation of institutional work that spans three distinct domains: i) ‚Äòreimagining‚Äô, ii) ‚Äòrecoding‚Äô and iii) ‚Äòreconfiguring‚Äô. This article demonstrates that the three domains can be understood to reiteratively feed into each other in what we call the ‚Äòtriple re-cycle‚Äô. These iterations produce either bolstering effects that strengthen the potential for positive social equity outcomes or evaporative effects that diminish or undermine this potential. We empirically illustrate the framework in case studies from Germany and South Africa. Overall, we argue that the triple re-cycle, as a heuristic, can provide new insights by conceptually connecting multiple domains of agency in energy transitions, including discursive and material aspects, across different global contexts. Our hope is that identifying potential agency in this way supports work to improve the social equity outcomes of energy transitions globally.},

However, the impact of capacity expansion of renewables on the sustainability dimensions has not been rigor¬≠ ously assessed for the Indian scenario. In this perspective, the present research investigates the optimal capacity installation of renewables using a proposed modelling framework. The framework encompasses a multi-objective optimization model interlinked to a sustainability model. This work develops a simplified temporally resolved electricity model of India to explore nine broad scenarios. The Pareto front solutions are ranked under a set of decision-maker preference scenarios across six sustainability metrics, including economic dispatchability, emission, water-use, land-use, safety, and employment. Results indicate a possibility of 25.5\%‚Äì41.2\% of renewable penetration by 2030. The Pareto frontiers with a higher share of onshore wind, utility solar photo¬≠ voltaic, and dammed hydro are among the top-ranked solutions. High river hydro supported by high levels of offshore wind can significantly contribute to low carbon generation without overshooting the upfront cost. Overall, the electricity mix with the least coal power generation of 1175 {TWh}/yr estimates to be the most sustainable solution. This paper addresses the sensitivity to changes in input lifetime year and cost assumptions; output shows considerable robustness of annual system costs to the lifetime of technologies and higher sensitivity to utility solar and onshore wind costs.},

	abstract = {Poverty, climate change and energy security demand awareness about the interlinkages between energy systems and social justice. Amidst these challenges, energy justice has emerged to conceptualize a world where all individuals, across all areas, have safe, affordable and sustainable energy that is, essentially, socially just. Simultaneously, new social and technological solutions to energy problems continually evolve, and interest in the concept of sociotechnical transitions has grown. However, an element often missing from such transitions frameworks is explicit engagement with energy justice frameworks. Despite the development of an embryonic set of literature around these themes, an obvious research gap has emerged: can energy justice and transitions frameworks be combined? This paper argues that they can. It does so through an exploration of the multi-level perspective on sociotechnical systems and an integration of energy justice at the model's niche, regime and landscape level. It presents the argument that it is within the overarching process of sociotechnical change that issues of energy justice emerge. Here, inattention to social justice issues can cause injustices, whereas attention to them can provide a means to examine and potential resolve them.},

But in planning such a transition, it is common to consider primarily cost and greenhouse gas reduction, as typified by cost-mitigation curves that have become widespread. Such assessments tend to leave important considerations of energy justice on the periphery. This paper puts forward an alternative assessment technique, incorporating various indicators of social equity in order to assess the priority of power plant replacement that would lead to the greatest improvement in benefits, while placing the burden of system changes away from the most vulnerable. An example of the application of this approach is presented for prioritization of the retirement and replacement (with {RE}) of Australia s ageing fleet of coal-fired power plants. The assessment shows very different results from a standard cost-mitigation approach, with the retirement of the large brown coal power plants (including the recently retired Hazelwood power plant) and the replacement with wind power (where applicable) promoting the best overall outcomes on both cost and equity. Considering a selection of high priority indicators with many locally-specific data sets, the approach adds significant contextual relevance to prioritization, and is considered to offer useful findings for policy-makers.},

Drawing on the strengths of both sets of literature, we argue that a comprehensive approach requires analyses to account for the co-evolution of institutional change, material change and relational change, with a cross-cutting concern for multiple spatialities and normative implications. We then illustrate this approach through three brief case studies of multi-scalar solar uptake in Portugal, bringing out how justice considerations are intricately involved in the practices and politics of these concrete, broadly representative instances of sustainable energy transitions.},

By applying an explicitly spatial lens to conceptualize energy poverty as a form of injustice, it contributes to debates in the domain of ‚Äòenergy justice‚Äô, where previous examinations of energy deprivation through a justice framing have focused on inequalities between social groups and often marginalized questions of spatial difference. We start from the premise that geographic disparities in the risk and incidence of domestic energy deprivation are a key component of energy justice. An extensive literature review has allowed us to highlight the spatial and temporal variation of cross-sectoral and entire-energy-chain injustices that lead to elevated energy poverty risks. These processes contribute to the rise of energy injustices via four mechanisms ‚Äì which we term landscapes of material deprivation, geographic underpinnings of energy affordability, vicious cycles of vulnerability, and spaces of misrecognition ‚Äì operating at a multiplicity of scales. While lending some support to area-based approaches towards energy poverty alleviation, our findings also suggest that such policies alone may marginalize the underlying structural dynamics that (re)produce spatial inequalities. Therefore, achieving energy justice necessitates broader interventions in the fundamental driving forces of spatial inequality.},

We present a model that takes a whole-system view of the {UK} spatial economy, examining how increasing distance costs (e.g. through fuel tax hikes) have unequal impacts on regions and sectors. The model establishes an important carbon transition policy principle: change in spatial flows of internal trade, which are certain to occur rapidly during transition, have measurable energy justice implications. Peripheral economic regions, in rural and coastal areas and many city outskirts are most vulnerable, as are petrochemical, agricultural and connected sectors. Policy must go beyond identifying places and sectors most affected: it is the connections between them that matter most. The "push" of spatially aware fiscal policy needs to be combined with the "pull" of targeted interventions designed to promote low-carbon intermediate connections. This is not only just, but would help make (potentially costly) transition more politically acceptable.},

Key Points:
Members from various organizations aligned with local transit riders to create the Transportation Coalition and advocate for extended night and weekend services for the Winston-Salem public transportation system.

Conclusions:
Partnerships between community-based organizations are crucial to identifying and addressing the needs of a community. The Transportation Coalition will continue its work in local public transportation policy. A long-term policy objective is fare-free transit on the city bus system.},

	shorttitle = {Quantifying the social equity state of an energy system},
	abstract = {A fundamental societal concern in energy system transitions is the distribution of benefits and costs across populations. A recent transition, the {US} shale gas boom, has dramatically altered the domestic energy outlook and global markets; however, the social equity implications have not been meaningfully assessed and accounted for in public and private decision making. In this study, we develop and demonstrate a systematic approach to quantify the multi-dimensional equity state of an energy system, with a focus on the shale gas boom in the Appalachian basin. We tailor variants of standard equity metrics as well as develop new empirical and analytical methods and metrics to assess spatial, temporal, income, and racial equity as it relates to air quality, climate change, and labor market impacts across the natural gas supply chain. We find moderate to high spatial inequities with respect to the distribution of production (Gini coefficient (Œ∑) = 0.93), consumption for electric power generation (Œ∑ = 0.68), commercial, industrial, and residential end use (Œ∑ = 0.72), job creation (Œ∑ = 0.72), and air pollution-related deaths (Œ∑ = 0.77), which are largely driven by geographically-fixed natural gas abundance and demand. Air quality impacts are also regressive, such that mortality risk induced by natural gas activity generally increases as income decreases; for example, mortality risk (m) (in units of premature mortality per 100 000 people) for the lowest income class ({\textless}\$15 000; m = 0.22 in 2016) is higher (18\%‚Äì31\%) than for the highest income class ({\textgreater}\$150 000; m = 0.27 in 2016). These risks are higher for white (m = 0.30 in 2016) than non-white (m = 0.16 in 2016) populations, which is largely a result of the demographics of rural communities within the vicinity of natural gas development. With respect to local labor market impacts within producing counties, we find marginal declines in income inequality (2.8\% ¬± 1.0\%) and poverty rates (9.9\% ¬± 1.7\%) during the boom, although household income increases for the wealthiest and decreases for the poorest. At a systems-level, there is an implied air quality-employment tradeoff of 3 ({\textless}1 to 7) job-years created per life-year lost; this tradeoff varies spatially (‚àí1100 to 4400 life-years lost minus job-years created), wherein the job benefit outweighs the air quality costs in most producing counties whereas in all other counties the reverse is true. We also observe temporal inequities, with air quality and employment impacts following the boom-and-bust cycle, while climate impacts are largely borne by future generations. Cross-impact elasticities (Œµ), which measure the sensitivity between different types of impacts, reveal that employment increases are sensitive to and coupled with increases in air and climate impacts (Œµ = 1.1 and Œµ = 1.3, respectively). The metrics applied here facilitate the evaluation and design of countervailing policies and systems that explicitly account for social inequities mediated through energy infrastructure, supply, and demand. For example, in future energy system transition, such equity metrics can be used to facilitate decisions related to the siting of low-carbon infrastructure such as transmission lines and wind turbines and the phase-out of fossil fuel infrastructure, as well as to demonstrate changes in distributional tradeoffs such as the decoupling of environmental and employment effects.},

	abstract = {Energy system modelling supports decision-makers in the development of short and long-term energy strategies. In the field of bottom-up short-term energy system models, high resolution in time and space, the implementation of sector coupling and the adoption of a multi-objective investment optimization have never been achieved simultaneously because of the high computational effort. Within this paper, such a bottom-up shortterm model which simultaneously implements (i) hourly temporal resolution, (ii) multi-node approach thus high spatial resolution, (iii) integrates the electric, thermal and transport sectors and (iv) implements a multi-objective investment optimization method is proposed. The developed method is applied to the Italian energy system at 2050 to test and show its main features. The model allows the evaluation of the hourly curtailments for each node. The optimization highlights that the cheapest solutions work towards high curtailments and low investments in flexibility options. In order to further reduce the {CO}2 emissions the investments in flexibility options like electric storage batteries and reinforcement and enlargement of the transmission grid become relevant.},

However, these impacts are entirely obscured by conventional least-cost analyses. Thus, this work compares the socio-economic impacts of various strategies to decarbonize the energy system by 2050 within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals ({SDGs}). We demonstrate that transitions that protect domestic strategic assets and preserve key industrial sectors correspondingly deliver a socially equitable transition. Adopting a technology-agnostic approach to decarbonizing the European electricity system maximizes the associated co-benefits and potentially increases the gross value added ({GVA}) to the economy by 50\% relative to a business as usual scenario. This new way of thinking about the economic transition fundamentally reframes the discussion from one of cost to one of opportunity.},

@report{clemmer_nuclear_2018,
	title = {The Nuclear Power Dilemma},
	abstract = {For decades, nuclear power has provided most of the
nation‚Äôs carbon-free electricity. However, the owners
have shut down many nuclear plants in the last five
years or announced plans to close them well before
their operating licenses expire, generating a discussion
among policymakers and regulators about the impact
of early retirements. The primary reasons for these
early closures are the economic challenges brought on
by cheap natural gas, diminished demand for
electricity, falling costs for renewable energy, rising
operating costs, and safety and performance problems.
The possibility that the nation will replace existing
nuclear plants with natural gas and coal rather than
low-carbon sources raises serious concerns about our
ability to achieve the deep cuts in carbon emissions
needed to limit the worst impacts of climate change.
 As of the end of 2017, 99 reactors at 60 power
plants provided 20 percent of {US} electricity
generation. The owners have retired six reactors at five
plants since 2013, slated seven reactors at five more
plants to retire over the next eight years, and
threatened to close five reactors at four more plants in
the next few years if they do not receive new financial
support.1
 In addition, Illinois, New Jersey, and New
York now provide financial support to keep 10 reactors at seven plants operating for at least 10 more years.
 The economic challenges facing nuclear plants are
part of a historic transition in the {US} electricity sector.
Over the last decade, natural gas generation and
renewable energy generation from wind and solar have
grown rapidly as their prices have fallen. Combined
with investments in energy efficiency, these energy
sources have largely replaced generation from retiring
coal plants, resulting in a 28 percent reduction in {US}
power-sector emissions of carbon dioxide ({CO}2) below
2005 levels in 2017. While nuclear power‚Äôs share of
electric power production has remained relatively flat
over the past decade, most analysts project that share
to decline in the future without additional financial or
policy support.
 The transition already has resulted in many
benefits, including lower electricity prices, technological innovation, a cleaner environment, and increased
customer control over energy use. However, in the
absence of national policy to reduce carbon emissions,
the transition has undervalued all types of low-carbon
sources of electricity and underpriced natural gas and
coal relative to their damage to the climate.
 The Union of Concerned Scientists ({UCS}) has
assessed the economic viability and performance of
most of the nuclear power plants operating in the
United States, analyzing which ones are most at risk of
early retirement and evaluating the main factors that
affect competitiveness. We also identified reactors that
have been safe, reliable performers and those with
troubled performance records. In addition, using a
national model of the electricity sector, {UCS} has
analyzed the impacts on the {US} electricity mix, {CO}2
emissions, and consumer electricity bills of three
scenarios for retiring nuclear plants early and two
scenarios based on the introduction of national policies
to reduce carbon emissions.},

	abstract = {A reliable and cost-effective electricity system transition requires both the identification of optimal target states and the definition of political and regulatory frameworks that enable these target states to be achieved. Fundamental optimization models are frequently used for the determination of cost-optimal system configurations. They represent a normative approach and typically assume markets with perfect competition. However, it is well known that real systems do not behave in such an optimal way, as decision-makers do not have perfect information at their disposal and real market actors do not take decisions in a purely rational way. These deficiencies lead to increased costs or missed targets, often referred to as an ‚Äúefficiency gap‚Äù. For making rational political decisions, it might be valuable to know which factors influence this efficiency gap and to what extent. In this paper, we identify and quantify this gap by soft-linking a fundamental electricity market model and an agent-based simulation model, which allows the consideration of these effects. In order to distinguish between model-inherent differences and non-ideal market behavior, a rigorous harmonization of the models was conducted first. The results of the comparative analysis show that the efficiency gap increases with higher renewable energy shares and that information deficits and policy instruments affect operational decisions of power market participants and resulting overall costs significantly.},

This paper introduces an agent-based model that allows studying the impact of changing energy policy instruments on the economic performance of {RES} operators and marketers. The model structure, its components, and linkages are presented in detail; an additional case study demonstrates the capability of our sociotechnical model. We find that changes in the political framework cannot be mapped directly to {RES} operators as behaviour of intermediary market actors has to be considered as well. Characteristics and strategies of intermediaries are thus an important factor for successful {RES} marketing and further deployment.

Using data for recentlyinstalled systems, we estimate the balance of beneÔ¨Åts and costs associated with installing a nonutility solar {PV} system today. We also study the geographical distribution of the various subsidies that are made available to owners of rooftop solar {PV} systems, and compare it to distributions of population and income. We Ô¨Ånd that, after accounting for federal subsidies and local rebates and assuming a discount rate of 7\%, the private beneÔ¨Åts of new installations will exceed private costs only in seven of the 19 states for which we have data and only if customers can sell excess power to the electric grid at the retail price. These states are characterized by abundant sunshine (California, Texas and Nevada) or by high electricity prices (New York). Public beneÔ¨Åts from reduced air pollution and climate change impact exceed the costs of the various subsidies offered system owners for less than 10\% of the systems installed, even assuming a 2\% discount rate. Subsidies Ô¨Çowed disproportionately to counties with higher median incomes in 2006. In 2014, the distribution of subsidies was closer to that of population income, but subsidies still Ô¨Çowed disproportionately to the better-off. The total, upfront, subsidy per kilowatt of installed capacity has fallen from \$5200 in 2006 to \$1400 in 2014, but the absolute magnitude of subsidy has soared as installed capacity has grown explosively. We see considerable differences in the balance of costs and beneÔ¨Åts even within states, indicating that local factors such as system price and solar resource are important, and that policies (e.g. net metering) could be made more efÔ¨Åcient by taking local conditions into account.},

	abstract = {How can leaders successfully craft energy or climate policy to support an initiative that citizens oppose? This paper considers this challenge from a change management perspective applied to public governance. It Ô¨Årst draws on change management theory to develop a framework for altering mass public perspectives. The framework consists of four phases: i) problematizing the issue, ii) laying a foundation for change, iii) reshaping perspectives, and iv) entrenching support. Drawing from the insights gleaned from the establishment of Japan's nuclear power program, the paper further argues that in order to succeed in mass perceptual change, policymakers must Ô¨Årst clearly understand the contextual environment in which the policy is being formulated. In doing so, policymakers will be better able to customize policy design to appeal to stakeholder perceptions and sentiments. Although the context of this paper is the perceptual modiÔ¨Åcation of public opinion to support nuclear power, the authors suggest that the same framework can be applied to perceptual modiÔ¨Åcation of any policy that the general public might be opposed to. In the energy sector, this could apply to fostering a transition to renewable energy as easily as it applies to nurturing nuclear power development. However, the Japanese case puts forth a caveat in this regard, there is evidence that the mindsets of the Japanese policymakers were predisposed to advocacy of nuclear power and once policymakers commit to a technological trajectory, it is hard to engender a change of course. Therefore, the article concludes by speculating on how the perceptions of policymakers might be similarly altered through eÔ¨Äorts from the alternative energy sector to foster policy change.},

Using the case of the ambitious and publicly-approved Swiss Energy Strategy 2050, we set up a bottom-up, technology-rich electricity system model {EXPANSE} with Modeling to Generate Alternatives at a spatial resolution of 2‚Äô258 Swiss municipalities. In order to measure regional equity implication, we adapt the concepts of the Lorenz curve and the Gini coeÔ¨Écient. We Ô¨Ånd a signiÔ¨Åcant trade-oÔ¨Ä by 2035 in Switzerland: 50\% increase in regional equity when allocating {DREG} to various Swiss regions on the basis of population or electricity demand leads to 18\% higher electricity generation costs. Least-cost allocation implies concentrating {DREG} and associated investments to few most productive locations only. Solar {PV} is the key technology for increasing regional equity. We conclude that in countries with spatially-uneven {DREG} resources like Switzerland, any policies that focus on cost eÔ¨Éciency should anticipate regional equity implications in advance and, if desired, minimize them by promoting solar {PV}.},

We find that minimum distances between renewable power plants and human settlements should be as small as is legally possible. Even small reductions in efficiency lead to large increases in equity.

In {HE}, socio-technical thinking is fundamental as {HE} projects exist at the intersection of engineering and sustainable community development. However, the literature still lacks an understanding of the key features of socio-technical thinking. Purpose/Hypothesis The purpose of this article is to investigate the key characteristics that distinguish the socio-technical thinking of an expert from a novice in the context of {HE} projects. Design/Method We distributed the Energy Conversion Playground ({ECP}) design task to students starting their engineering degree (n = 26) and practitioners (n = 16). We iteratively and inductively analyzed the responses to develop a rubric characterizing the key features of expert socio-technical thinking. We then scored participants' responses and compared them to identify differences between students and practitioners. Results The analysis showed that expert socio-technical thinkers can provide high-quality considerations across three domains: technology, people, and broader context. The comparison of the participants' scores showed that both students and practitioners scored highly in the technology domain. In contrast, students scored poorly in the people and broader contexts domains, identifying only simplistic considerations in these non-technical areas, if at all. Conclusions This study provides novel insights into the development of socio-technical thinking and further validates the {ECP} as a trustworthy measure of socio-technical thinking. Implications for engineering educators and multiple lines of future research are also discussed.},

	abstract = {International, national, and subnational laws and policies call for rapidly decarbonizing energy systems around the globe. This effort relies heavily on renewable electricity and calls for a transition that is: (i) flexible enough to accommodate existing and new electricity end uses and users; (ii) resilient in response to climate change and other threats to electricity infrastructure; (iii) cost-effective in comparison to alternatives; and (iv) just in the face of energy systems that are often the result of‚Äîor the cause of‚Äîprocedural, distributive, and historical injustices. Acknowledging the intertwined roles of technology and policy, this work provides a cross-disciplinary review of how microgrids may contribute to renewable electricity systems that are flexible, resilient, cost-effective, and just (including illustrative examples from Korea, California, New York, the European Union, and elsewhere). Following this review of generalized microgrid characteristics, we more closely examine the role and potential of microgrids in two United States jurisdictions that have adopted 100\% renewable electricity standards (Hawai‚Äòi and Puerto Rico), and which are actively developing regulatory regimes putatively designed to enable renewable microgrids. Collectively, this review shows that although microgrids have the potential to support the transition to 100\% renewable electricity in a variety of ways, the emerging policy structures require substantial further development to operationalize that potential. We conclude that unresolved fundamental policy tensions arise from justice considerations, such as how to distribute the benefits and burdens of microgrid infrastructure, rather than from technical questions about microgrid topologies and operating characteristics. Nonetheless, technical and quantitative future research will be necessary to assist regulators as they develop microgrid policies. In particular, there is a need to develop socio‚Äìtechno‚Äìeconomic analyses of cost-effectiveness, which consider a broad range of potential benefits and costs.},

	abstract = {Natural gas is the fossil fuel with lowest {CO}2-emissions, compared to coal, lignite or oil. Regarding the ongoing energy transition in Germany, the extend usage of natural gas provide advantages that might be built a bridge to a low carbon energy system until 2050. Against this backdrop, this paper introduces a model for the German natural gas market ({GAMAMOD}-{DE}) with focus on infrastructure utilisation. Following a linear optimization approach, the model considers a highly resolved grid structure of pipelines, storages and cross-border connections to neighbouring countries. The spatial and temporal resolved gas demand is divided into three different sectors: industry, heating and electricity. An application for the year 2012 shows the performance and validation of the proposed model. Results show the utilisation of infrastructure and enable an assessment of the level of security of supply during the considered time frame. In addition, the findings suggest that although European customers suffered on cold winter days in 2012, from a system part of view, the security of supply ({SoS}) was always ensured. Further research should focus on analysing {SoS} and resilience of gas networks in the mid- and longterm, especially when sector coupling between electricity and gas is far advanced.},

The efficacy of the proposed algorithm in solving various problems is demonstrated on a number of test problems chosen from the literature.

Modeling to Generate Alternatives ({MGA}) is an approach for addressing unmodeled issues in an optimization context. {MGA} techniques are used to generate a small number of good, yet very different, solutions to optimization problems. Because these solutions are different in decision space, they may differ considerably in performance when unmodeled objectives are considered. Many problems are sufficiently complex that traditional optimization solution procedures, and therefore traditional {MGA} techniques, are not readily applicable. Two techniques for performing {MGA} using genetic algorithms ({GAs}) are investigated and compared. One of these techniques, which uses specialized {MGA} operators, is shown to produce solutions that are both better in quality and more different. This technique is also demonstrated for a realistic air quality management problem.},

Formal approaches to explore efficiently for good but maximally different alternative solutions have been established in the operations research literature, and have been shown to be valuable in identifying solutions that perform expectedly well with respect to modeled and unmodeled objectives. While the use of evolutionary algorithms ({EAs}) to solve real engineering optimization problems is becoming increasingly common, systematic alternatives-generation capabilities are not fully extended for {EAs}. This paper presents a new {EA}-based approach to generate alternatives ({EAGA}), and illustrates its applicability via two test problems. A realistic airline route network design problem was also solved and analyzed successfully using {EAGA}.

	abstract = {In a multi-objective optimization problem, in addition to optimal solutions, multimodal and/or nearly optimal alternatives can also provide additional useful information for the decision maker. However, obtaining all nearly optimal solutions entails an excessive number of alternatives. Therefore, to consider the nearly optimal solutions, it is convenient to obtain a reduced set, putting the focus on the potentially useful alternatives. These solutions are the alternatives that are close to the optimal solutions in objective space, but which differ significantly in the decision space. To characterize this set, it is essential to simultaneously analyze the decision and objective spaces. One of the crucial points in an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm is the archiving strategy. This is in charge of keeping the solution set, called the archive, updated during the optimization process. The motivation of this work is to analyze the three existing archiving strategies proposed in the literature ({ArchiveUpdatePQ},œµDxy, Archive\_nevMOGA, and {targetSelect}) that aim to characterize the potentially useful solutions. The archivers are evaluated on two benchmarks and in a real engineering example. The contribution clearly shows the main differences between the three archivers. This analysis is useful for the design of evolutionary algorithms that consider nearly optimal solutions.},

We examine four challenges they face and the efforts being taken to address them: (1) resolving time and space, (2) balancing uncertainty and transparency, (3) addressing the growing complexity of the energy system, and (4) integrating human behavior and social risks and opportunities.

	abstract = {\textit{Wastelanding} tells the history of the uranium industry on Navajo land in the U.S. Southwest, asking why certain landscapes and the peoples who inhabit them come to be targeted for disproportionate exposure to environmental harm. Uranium mines and mills on the Navajo Nation land have long supplied U.S. nuclear weapons and energy programs. By 1942, mines on the reservation were the main source of uranium for the top-secret Manhattan Project. Today, the Navajo Nation is home to more than a thousand abandoned uranium sites. Radiation-related diseases are endemic, claiming the health and lives of former miners and nonminers alike.  Traci Brynne Voyles argues that the presence of uranium mining on Din√© (Navajo) land constitutes a clear case of environmental racism. Looking at discursive constructions of landscapes, she explores how environmental racism develops over time. For Voyles, the "wasteland," where toxic materials are excavated, exploited, and dumped, is both a racial and a spatial signifier that renders an environment and the bodies that inhabit it pollutable. Because environmental inequality is inherent in the way industrialism operates, the wasteland is the "other" through which modern industrialism is established.  In examining the history of wastelanding in Navajo country, Voyles provides "an environmental justice history" of uranium mining, revealing how just as "civilization" has been defined on and through "savagery," environmental privilege is produced by portraying other landscapes as marginal, worthless, and pollutable.},

Amongst {LCE} projects, hydropower was found to have the highest number of conflicts with concerns over social and environmental damages. (3) Repression and violence against protesters and land defenders was rife in almost all activities, with 10\% of all cases analysed involving assassination of activists. Violence was particularly common in relation to hydropower, biomass, pipelines and coal extraction. Wind, solar and other renewables were the least conflictive and entailed lower levels of repression than other projects. The results caution that decarbonization of the economy is by no means inherently environmentally innocuous or socially inclusive. We find that conflicts and collective action are driven by multiple concerns through which community mobilization seeks to reshape the energy regime and its impacts. These include claims for localization, democratic participation, shorter energy chains, anti-racism, climate-justice-focused governance, and Indigenous leadership. Climate and energy policymakers need to pay closer attention to the demands and preferences of these collective movements pointing to transformative pathways to decarbonization.},

After presenting its activist roots and mapping its usage, ‚Äòenergy democracy‚Äô is positioned in relation to similar normatively derived concepts: environmental, climate, and energy justice, and environmental democracy. Drawing on insights from political theory and political sociology, it is shown what is democratic in energy democracy. Referencing the question of experts and democratic publics in complex technological areas, the paper explains why it is desirable for energy governance to be more democratic. To show what is unique in ‚Äòenergy democracy‚Äô beyond increased participation in energy policy, the prosumer is introduced as the ideal-typical citizen, highlighting the importance of the energy transition, the agency of material structures and a new emergent governmentality. ‚ÄòEnergy democracy‚Äô is conceptualized as an analytical and decision-making tool, defined along three dimensions: popular sovereignty, participatory governance and civic ownership, and operationalized with relevant indicators.},

	abstract = {No one seriously questions that an improved and decarbonized energy supply system is a key component of climate change mitigation, but the United States‚Äô system of federalism complicates the siting of utility-scale renewable energy facilities. The new Biden Administration presents the United States with an opportunity to reimagine how this country regulates renewable energy siting, allowing for substantial national progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, primary siting authority for renewable energy projects rests with state and local governments, which generally exercise that authority through zoning and land use planning, while the federal government approves most interstate energy delivery systems. This fragmented system of governance can delay and even deter project development, simultaneously thwarting the optimal logic in developing a national renewable energy generation system. Proactive renewable energy project planning offers one potentially effective ‚Äì and constitutional ‚Äì solution to this renewable energy federalism dilemma, particularly in conjunction with negotiated siting guidelines and a centralized siting agency. Drawing upon the substantial body of scholarly work that advocates for federal or regional collaboration in renewable energy policymaking and for more balanced and dynamic federalism in the energy sector, this Article further advances those goals while also shifting the focal axis and underscoring renewable energy as the locus for expanding energy federalism and mitigating climate change.},

This study details how energy justice can serve as a novel conceptual tool for philosophers and ethicists that better integrates usually distinct distributive and procedural justice concerns. Energy justice serves as an important analytical tool for energy researchers striving to understand how values get built into energy systems or to resolve common energy problems. Energy justice presents a useful decision-making tool that can assist energy planners and consumers in making more informed energy choices. Our energy justice framework has elements of Kantian ethics, which takes each person as an end. It has libertarian elements of freedom and choice, suggesting that good societies present people with a set of opportunities or substantial freedoms, so they can choose to exercise these or not. It is pluralist about value, holding that capabilities for people are different and also that their own interests vary. It is concerned with justice as recognition, noting that failures of procedural justice can result in discrimination and marginalization. It, also, has elements focused on utilitarianism and welfare, attempting to improve the quality of life for all people, as defined by their capabilities.},

Yet oil presents a much larger problem for democracy: faced with the threats of oil depletion and catastrophic climate change, the democratic machineries that emerged to govern the age of carbon energy seem to be unable to address the processes that may end it. This article explores these multiple dimensions of carbon democracy, by examining the intersecting histories of coal, oil and democracy in the twentieth century. Following closely the methods by which fossil fuels were produced, distributed and converted into other forms of socio-technical organization, financial circulation and political power, the article traces ways in which the concentration and control of energy flows could open up democratic possibilities or close them down; how connections were engineered in the post-war period between the flow of oil and the flows of international finance, on which democratic stability was thought to depend; how these same circulations made possible the emergence of the economy and its unlimited growth as the main object of democratic politics; and how the relations among forms of energy, finance, economic knowledge, democracy and violence were transformed in the 1967‚Äì74 oil‚Äìdollar Middle East crises.},

	shorttitle = {The Price of Nuclear Power},
	abstract = {Rising fossil fuel prices and concerns about greenhouse gas emissions are fostering a nuclear power renaissance and a revitalized uranium mining industry across the American West. In \textit{The Price of Nuclear Power} , environmental sociologist Stephanie Malin offers an on-the-ground portrait of several uranium communities caught between the harmful legacy of previous mining booms and the potential promise of new economic development. Using this context, she examines how shifting notions of environmental justice inspire divergent views about nuclear power's sustainability and equally divisive forms of social activism.  Drawing on extensive fieldwork conducted in rural isolated towns such as Monticello, Utah, and Nucla and Naturita, Colorado, as well as in upscale communities like Telluride, Colorado, and incorporating interviews with community leaders, environmental activists, radiation regulators, and mining executives, Malin uncovers a fundamental paradox of the nuclear renaissance: the communities most hurt by uranium's legacy-such as high rates of cancers, respiratory ailments, and reproductive disorders-were actually quick to support industry renewal. She shows that many impoverished communities support mining not only because of the employment opportunities, but also out of a personal identification with uranium, a sense of patriotism, and new notions of environmentalism. But other communities, such as Telluride, have become sites of resistance, skeptical of industry and government promises of safe mining, fearing that regulatory enforcement won't be strong enough. Indeed, Malin shows that the nuclear renaissance has exacerbated social divisions across the Colorado Plateau, threatening social cohesion. Malin further illustrates ways in which renewed uranium production is not a socially sustainable form of energy development for rural communities, as it is utterly dependent on unstable global markets.   \textit{The Price of Nuclear Power} is an insightful portrait of the local impact of the nuclear renaissance and the social and environmental tensions inherent in the rebirth of uranium mining.},

These visions of energy justice ‚Äì authored by the actors and communities that have historically organized energy justice programming ‚Äì are largely absent in the energy justice literature, but they provide guidance on research and policy gaps. This article provides a review and thematic coding of visions for a just energy future, which enables an understanding of how energy justice links to history, policy, and other social movements, and concretizes calls for ‚Äúplace-based‚Äù, ‚Äúfrontline-centered‚Äù, and ‚Äúspatially situated‚Äù approaches to energy justice. We find that organizations draft visioning documents because of the inherent value of community visioning to build shared political will, to assert their priorities in a policy space that has historically disregarded equity and justice, and to move climate policy in a transformative direction. That so many visioning documents exist suggests the insufficiency of current policy approaches, which are described in visioning documents as deficient in addressing the root causes and economic structures driving climate change. Additionally, we identify 6 principles of a just energy future articulated in these documents: (1) being place-based, (2) addressing the root causes and legacies of inequality, (3) shifting the balance of power in existing forms of energy governance, (4) creating new, cooperative, and participatory systems of energy governance and ownership, (5) adopting a rights-based approach, and (6) rejecting false solutions. We discuss how these principles can advance the energy justice literature and be applied across areas of energy policy intervention and geographies.},

While some individuals, households and communities are reaping the benefits of the move toward cleaner, renewable sources of energy, others are experiencing its adverse effects, such as disruptions to labor markets, higher energy prices, and pollution and health burdens. To address these disparities, policymakers are increasingly calling for energy justice. However, there is scant scholarly literature on either the prevalence or characteristics of energy justice programs that already exist. Here we show that energy justice programs are both quite widespread and diverse across the United States, are most often led by nonprofit organizations rather than government agencies, and, while many share common missions, programs entail unique and often innovative strategies to achieve their objectives. The analysis lends important insights into current energy justice programs, but we argue deeper evaluation is necessary to identify which efforts are efficacious.},

While most discussions of climate justice in the academic literature focus on ideal conceptions and normative arguments of justice theory, or on the pragmatic policy of the more elite environmental nongovernmental organizations ({NGOs}), a distinct discourse has developed out of the grassroots. In these movement articulations of climate justice, the concerns and principles of environmental justice are clear and consistent. Here, climate justice focuses on local impacts and experience, inequitable vulnerabilities, the importance of community voice, and demands for community sovereignty and functioning. This review traces the discourse of environmental justice from its development, through the range of principles and demands of grassroots climate justice movements, to more recent articulations of ideas for just adaptation to climate change.

We link themes of violence and the role of the state in the expansion of environmental justice studies to the major topics of land and resource conflicts, prisons and incarceration, and emotions. We draw on this scholarship to explore how theories and politics of environmental justice are inflected by the constraints and leverage points within racial capitalism, settler colonialism, and the afterlives of enslavement.

	abstract = {Although a large body of quantitative environmental justice research exists, only a handful of studies have examined the processes by which racial and socioeconomic disparities in the location of polluting industrial facilities can occur. These studies have had mixed results, we contend, principally because of methodological differences, that is, the use of the unit-hazard coincidence method as compared to distance-based methods. This study is the first national-level environmental justice study to conduct longitudinal analyses using distance-based methods. Our purposes are to: (1) determine whether disparate siting, post-siting demographic change, or a combination of the two created present-day disparities; (2) test related explanations; and (3) determine whether the application of distance-based methods helps resolve the inconsistent findings of previous research. We used a national database of commercial hazardous waste facilities sited from 1966 to 1995 and examined the demographic composition of host neighborhoods around the time of siting and demographic changes that occurred after siting. We found strong evidence of disparate siting for facilities sited in all time periods. Although we found some evidence of post-siting demographic changes, they were mostly a continuation of changes that occurred in the decade or two prior to siting, suggesting that neighborhood transition serves to attract noxious facilities rather than the facilities themselves attracting people of color and low income populations. Our findings help resolve inconsistencies among the longitudinal studies and builds on the evidence from other subnational studies that used distance-based methods. We conclude that racial discrimination and sociopolitical explanations (i.e., the proposition that siting decisions follow the ‚Äòpath of least resistance‚Äô) best explain present-day inequities.},

Also considered is the value of perspectives from critical race theory and ethnic studies for making sense of these social phenomena.

	abstract = {Despite the recognition that institutions matter for international development, the debates over institutional reforms tend to obscure the role of power. Neoliberal models of development are often promoted in terms of their technical merits and efficiency gains and rarely account for the multiple ways that social, economic and political power shape institutional design and institutional change. Even recent efforts to address power tend to conceptualize it too narrowly. This special issue seeks to rethink the role of power in institutional creation and change in the context of persistent neoliberalism. In the introduction, we synthesize the literature on the nature of power to develop a new conceptual framework ‚Äì a power in institutions matrix ‚Äì that highlights the multiple dimensions of power involved in institutional development and change. We argue that such a theoretically-informed mapping of power in institutions will enable scholars, practitioners, and citizen groups to go beyond the standard critiques in order to analyze the multifaceted effects of neoliberal institutional change. Our introduction draws on an extensive literature review as well as the special issue contributors who examine institutional change in a variety of policy sectors in Africa, South Asia, Latin America, and North America. We find that a range of diverse local, national and transnational actors, with disparate access to power, negotiate institutional changes from above and below through overt imposition of and resistance to new rules, influence of agendas, and promotion of discourses. Neoliberalism thus creates a new distributive politics. The special issue thus offers a theoretically-grounded approach for linking international and domestic power differences to the process of institutional change, with a specific focus on equity and sustainability. In a departure from the current literature‚Äôs focus on elite bargains, we showcase the efforts by less powerful groups to gain a foothold in decision-making processes.},

	abstract = {In this article we introduce a Special Issue of Energy Research and Social Science focused on energy infrastructure and the political economy of national development. Many countries are experiencing transformational growth in energy infrastructure, such as transmission and distribution systems; import, export and storage facilities; the development of domestic energy resources; and construction of new power generating stations based on wind, water, coal, gas and nuclear sources. Large-scale projects like these are frequently justified by appeals to grand narratives ‚Äì promoting economic growth, securing energy supply, modernizing energy service provision, and transitioning to more environmentally sustainable energy systems - in which the fate of the nation is closely tied to infrastructural development. The papers in this collection present compelling empirical evidence of how claims for energy infrastructure‚Äôs national significance and/or necessity intersect with the (re)production of political and economic power. Drawing on case material from Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe, they highlight the capacity of different energy technologies and infrastructural assemblages to shape political and economic outcomes beyond their role in storing, transporting or transforming energy. This Introduction to the Special Issue does three things. First, it characterises the scale and significance of the contemporary ‚Äòinfrastructural moment‚Äô, observing how, in many national contexts, energy policy-making remains centralised and divorced from public participation. Second, it critically differentiates existing literature on the political economy of energy infrastructure to identify five distinctive ways in which research understands the ‚Äòpolitical work‚Äô infrastructure performs. Third, it introduces the papers in the Special Issue and organises them into four key themes. Overall, the Introduction affirms the importance for social science of understanding the economically and politically constitutive power of energy infrastructures. The critical reflexivity this requires is essential to moving towards energy infrastructures that are just, equitable and sustainable.},

Here, I suggest that this state-theoretical explanation of the glass ceiling needs to be supplemented by an analysis of why democratic norms and procedures, which had once been regarded as essential for any socio-ecological transformation, suddenly appear as one of its main obstacles. I conceptualise the new eco-political dysfunctionality of democracy as one dimension of a more encompassing legitimation crisis of democracy which, in turn, has triggered a profound transformation of democracy. Ultimately, exactly this transformation constitutes the glass ceiling to the socio-ecological restructuring of capitalist consumer societies. It changes democracy into a tool for the politics of unsustainability, in which the legitimation-dependent state is a key actor.},

	abstract = {In future electricity systems, not only electricity generation but also frequency stabilization must be provided by low-carbon technologies. Battery systems are a promising solution to fill this gap. However, uncertainties regarding their revenue potential may hinder investments. Therefore, we apply the agent-based electricity market model {AMIRIS} to simulate a day-ahead market and an automatic frequency restoration reserves market. Demonstrating the model setup, we chose a scenario with high shares of renewable energies. First, we back-test our model with historic market data from Germany in 2019. The simulation results‚Äô mean day-ahead prices of 39.20EUR/{MWh} are close to the historic ones of 38.70EUR/{MWh}. Second, we model both markets in a scenario for 2030. The simulated day-ahead market prices are higher on average than observed today, although, we find around 550¬†h/yr in which the load is fully covered by renewable energies. The variance in simulated prices is slightly higher compared to historic values. Bids on the reserve capacity market are derived from opportunity costs of not participating in the day-ahead market. This results in prices of up to 45EUR/{MW} for positive reserve while the prices for negative reserve are 0EUR/{MW}. Finally, we evaluate revenue potentials of battery storages. Compared to 2019, we see an improved economic potential and increased importance of the day-ahead market. High power battery storages perform best whereas improvements in round-trip efficiency only marginally improve revenues. Although demonstrated for Germany, the presented modular approach can be adapted to international markets enabling comprehensive battery storage assessments.},

Integrating these new energy resources and technologies will lead to profound structural changes in energy systems, such as an increasing need for storage and a radical electrification of the heating and mobility sectors. To capture the increasing complexity of such future energy systems, new flexible and open-source optimization modelling tools are needed. This paper presents {EnergyScope} {TD}, a novel open-source model for the strategic energy planning of urban and regional energy systems. Compared to other existing energy models, which are often proprietary, computationally expensive and mostly focused on the electricity sector, {EnergyScope} {TD} optimises both the investment and operating strategy of an entire energy system (including electricity, heating and mobility). Additionally, its hourly resolution (using typical days) makes the model suitable for the integration of intermittent renewables, and its concise mathematical formulation and computational efficiency are appropriate for uncertainty applications. We present the linear programming model, detailing its formulation, and we apply it to a real-world case study to discuss advantages and disadvantages in comparison to other modelling frameworks. In particular, we model the national energy system of Switzerland to evaluate a 50\% renewable energy scenario.},

Both of these technologies are considered baseload-capable with sufficient available fuel (sunlight or fissible material) to provide large amounts of nearly emissions-free electricity. We find that under a range of technological learning assumptions, {CSP} compares favorably against nuclear on costs in the period to 2030, and has lower investment and environmental risks. The results suggest that while nuclear power may be an important low-emissions power technology in regions with little sun, in the case of South Africa, {CSP} could be capable of providing a stable baseload supply at lower cost than nuclear power, and may have other non-cost benefits.},

	abstract = {Mitigating climate change is driving the need to decarbonize the electricity sector, for which various possible technological options exist, alongside uncertainty over which options are preferable in terms of cost, emissions reductions, and energy security. To reduce this uncertainty, we here quantify two questions for the power system of Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland): First, when compared within the same high-resolution modeling framework, how much do different combinations of technologies differ in these three respects? Second, how strongly does the cost and availability of grid-scale storage affect overall system cost, and would it favor some technology combinations above others? We compare three main possible generation technologies: (1) renewables, (2) nuclear, and (3) fossil fuels (with/without carbon capture and storage). Our results show that across a wide range of these combinations, the overall costs remain similar, implying that different configurations are equally feasible both technically and economically. However, the most economically favorable scenarios are not necessarily favorable in terms of emissions or energy security. The availability of grid-scale storage in scenarios with little dispatchable generation can reduce overall levelized electricity cost by up to 50\%, depending on storage capacity costs. The {UK} can rely on its domestic wind and solar {PV} generation at lower renewable shares, with levelized costs only rising more than 10\% above the mean of 0.084 {GBP}/{kWh} for shares of 50\% and below at a 70\% share, which is 35\% higher. However, for more than an 80\% renewable generation share to be economically feasible, large-scale storage, significantly more power imports, or domestic dispatchable renewables like tidal range must be available.},

We study the effects of {CO}2 price floors and a price ceiling on the dynamic investment pathway of two interlinked electricity markets (loosely based on Great Britain, which already has introduced a price floor, and on Central Western Europe). Using an agent-based electricity market simulation with endogenous investment and a {CO}2 market (including banking), we analyse the cross-border effects of national policies as well as system-wide policy options. A common, moderate {CO}2 auction reserve price results in a more continuous decarbonisation pathway. This reduces {CO}2 price volatility and the occurrence of carbon shortage price periods, as well as the average cost to consumers. A price ceiling can shield consumers from extreme price shocks. These price restrictions do not cause a large risk of an overall emissions overshoot in the long run. A national price floor lowers the cost to consumers in the other zone; the larger the zone with the price floor, the stronger the effect. Price floors that are too high lead to inefficiencies in investment choices and to higher consumer costs.},

Starting from this particular grid model we characterize the structure of the German transmission grid by means of graph-theoretical decomposition approaches to complexity reduction. Our procedure aims to identify key features and characteristics complementing the grid‚Äôs electrotechnical properties; it is for example used to characterize the {SciGRID} approach and validate the resulting models against other (potentially not open source) transmission network models.

This paper describes the open-source {MEDEAS} modeling framework, which has been developed with the aim of informing decision-making to achieve the transition to sustainable energy systems with a focus on biophysical, economic, social and technological restrictions and tackling some of the limitations identified in the current {IAMs}. {MEDEAS} models include the following relevant characteristics: representation of biophysical constraints to energy availability; modeling of the mineral and energy investments for the energy transition, allowing a dynamic assessment of the potential mineral scarcities and computation of the net energy available to society; consistent representation of climate change damages with climate assessments by natural scientists; integration of detailed sectoral economic structure (input‚Äìoutput analysis) within a system dynamics approach; energy shifts driven by physical scarcity; and a rich set of socioeconomic and environmental impact indicators. The potentialities and novel insights that this framework brings are illustrated by the simulation of four variants of current trends with the {MEDEAS}-world model: the consideration of alternative plausible assumptions and methods, combined with the feedback-rich structure of the model, reveal dynamics and implications absent in classical models. Our results suggest that the continuation of current trends will drive significant biophysical scarcities and impacts which will most likely derive in regionalization (priority to security concerns and trade barriers), conflict, and ultimately, a severe global crisis which may lead to the collapse of our modern civilization. Despite depicting a much more worrying future than conventional projections of current trends, we however believe it is a more realistic counterfactual scenario that will allow the design of improved alternative sustainable pathways in future work.},

The mixed-integer linear program minimises total system cost while complying with operational constraints, carbon emission targets, and ancillary service requirements. A data clustering technique and the relaxation of integer scheduling constraints is evaluated and applied to decrease the model solution time. Two cost learning curves for the different power technologies are derived: one assuming local learning effects, the other accounting for global knowledge spill-over. A piece-wise linear formulation allows the integration of the exponential learning curves into the {ESO}-{XEL} model. The model is applied to the {UK} power system in the time frame of 2015 to 2050. The consideration of cost learning effects moves optimal investment timings to earlier planning years and influences the competitiveness of technologies. In addition, the maximum capacity build rate parameter influences the share of power generation significantly; the possibility of rapid capacity build-up is more important for total system cost reduction by 2050 than accounting for technology cost reduction.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a description of {ELMOD}, a model of the European electricity market including both generation and the physical transmission network ({DC} Load Flow approach). The model was developed at the Chair of Energy Economics and Public Sector Management ({EE}2) at Dresden University of Technology in order to analyze various questions on market design, congestion management, and investment decisions, with a focus on Germany and Continental Europe. {ELMOD} is a bottom-up model combining electrical engineering and economics: its objective function is welfare maximization, subject to line flow, energy balance, and generation constraints. The model provides simulations on an hourly basis, taking into account variable demand, wind input, unit commitment, start-up costs, pump storage, and other details. We report selected study results using {ELMOD}.},

Second, we introduce a new model that is specifically designed for exploring long-term storage requirements. The literature survey focuses on recent contributions in the peer-reviewed energy economics and engineering literature. We compare key characteristics of the different models, provide an overview of model applications, and summarize key findings on power storage requirements. We also evaluate which system values of storage are covered by respective model analyses. Based on the literature survey, we identify common findings and key model features required for a sound assessment of future storage requirements. In order to raise complementary insights, we introduce {DIETER}, a new dispatch and investment model. The model contributes to the literature by capturing multiple system values of power storage related to arbitrage, capacity, and reserve provision. Further, the model is designed as an open-source tool that can be freely used and modified. Results of a first application of the new model are presented in a companion paper.},

Various applications of battery energy storage systems can be simulated, for example, the increase of selfconsumption in households with {PV} and storage systems or the provision of primary control reserve. The main component of the modular and flexible software-tool is an abstract approach to the energy storage model, which allows the variation of different storage technologies and technical sub-components. Furthermore, stress characterization enables the estimation of the energy storage device's degradation. Various aging models can be used for this purpose, whereby detailed models based on aging experiments especially for batteries are currently developed at the {EES} Institute. In order to optimize the utilization of the energy storage in the different applications, a large number of operating strategies are implemented. Time series simulations allow for technical evaluations and calculation of relevant key figures. Furthermore, economic key performance indicators are derived and enable the assessment and comparison of the simulation results.

It provides power flow, optimal power flow, state estimation, topological graph searches and short circuit calculations according to {IEC} 60909. pandapower includes a Newton-Raphson power flow solver formerly based on {PYPOWER}, which has been accelerated with just-in-time compilation. Additional enhancements to the solver include the capability to model constant current loads, grids with multiple reference nodes and a connectivity check. The pandapower network model is based on electric elements, such as lines, two and three-winding transformers or ideal switches. All elements can be defined with nameplate parameters and are internally processed with equivalent circuit models, which have been validated against industry standard software tools. The tabular data structure used to define networks is based on the Python library pandas, which allows comfortable handling of input and output parameters. The implementation in Python makes pandapower easy to use and allows comfortable extension with third-party libraries. pandapower has been successfully applied in several grid studies as well as for educational purposes. A comprehensive, publicly available case-study demonstrates a possible application of pandapower in an automated time series calculation.},

The model simulates the electricity market operation for the entire region at half hourly resolution and produces results in terms of electricity prices, cross border flows, emissions and associated total system costs. The impact of two carbon prices is examined within the model. Results highlight the policy challenges that arise when individual Member States formulate renewable energy plans in isolation in the absence of integrated modelling of interconnected regions as cross border power flows play a more significant role in market dynamics especially in the presence of geographically dispersed variable renewable generation sources such as wind and solar. From a policy perspective results suggest that based on these national plans, congestion will be present on a number of key lines at long periods during the year.},

As an adequate approach, {MOCES} is capable of modeling physical systems as well as the mainly event-driven behavior of interacting entities and feedback loops across the domains. In addition, it covers timescales from seconds to days. Contrary to other approaches following an agent or co-simulation concept, {MOCES} is monolithic, based on the modeling language Modelica. To meet the requirements imposed on a simulation tool, we use the possibility to enhance Modelica within its language specification. The basic idea of {MOCES} is to extend the physical model of each entity by a connected representative in a parallel simulation. To show the feasibility of the concept, a simulation example investigates the benefits and drawbacks of local energy markets.},

	abstract = {The advancing energy transition is leading to a constantly increasing number of prosumers and active participants in the energy system. Local energy markets are considered a promising approach to coordinate those active participants efficiently, increase acceptance among the population, and decrease grid expansion costs. However, energy models and markets do not consider heterogeneous user preferences which are considered crucial for the progressing energy transition. Therefore, this paper proposes new auction-based local energy market models that consider user preferences and users‚Äô willingness to pay a premium for heterogeneous energy qualities. In order to account for the unknown and stochastic user behavior in such a new market setting, we simulate and compare existing and newly developed auction-based clearing algorithms with an unbiased Monte Carlo method and evaluate whether they fulfill pre-defined key characteristics. Based on the results, we conclude and identify a clearing algorithm that verifiably satisfies user preferences, considers willingness to pay a premium, increases local coverage of electricity, maintains individual rationality, and computational tractability. The presented clearing algorithms enable new market designs that can help to increase acceptance and accelerate the expansion of renewable energies. All market models and simulations are publicly available in the open-source repository lemlab. Future research will validate the presented results in a field trial in Germany with 20 households.},

Applying this methodology to Great Britain for 2050, we find that {VRE}-focused power system design is highly sensitive to the inter-annual variability of weather and that planning based on a single year can lead to operational inadequacy and failure to meet long-term decarbonization objectives. However, some insights do emerge that are relatively stable to weather-year. Reinforcement of the transmission system consistently leads to a decrease in system costs while electricity storage and flexible generation, needed to integrate {VRE} into the system, are generally deployed close to demand centres.},

	abstract = {Averting the impending harms of climate change requires to replace fossil fuels with renewables as a primary source of energy. Non-electric renewable potential being limited, this implies extending the use of electricity generated from wind and solar beyond the power sector, either by direct electrification or synthetic fuels. Modeling the transformation towards such an energy system is challenging, because it imposes to consider fluctuations of wind and solar and the manifold ways the demand side could adjust to these fluctuations. This paper introduces a graph-based method to formulate energy system models to address these challenges. By organizing sets in rooted trees, two features to facilitate modeling high shares of renewables and sector integration are enabled. First, the method allows the level of temporal and spatial detail to be varied by energy carrier. This enables modeling with a high level of detail and a large scope, while keeping models computationally tractable. Second, the degree to which energy carriers are substitutable when converted, stored, transported, or consumed can be modeled to achieve a detailed but flexible representation of sector integration. An application of the formulation demonstrates that the variation of temporal detail achieves an average reduction in computation time of 70{\textbackslash}\%.},

However, assessments and policy advice regarding ancillary services and market design lack methods to evaluate the complex interaction of markets and services. Therefore, this paper contributes an open-source agent-based model to test design options for ancillary services and electricity markets. The Ancillary Services Acquisition Model ({ASAM}) combines the agent-based modeling framework {MESA} with the toolbox Python for Power System Analysis ({PyPSA}). The model provides various design parameters per market and agent-specific strategies as well as detailed clearing algorithms for the day-ahead market, intra-day continuous trading, redispatch, and imbalances. Moreover, {ASAM} includes numerous policy performance indicators, including a novel price mark-up indicator and novel redispatch performance indicators. A stylized simulation scenario verified and validated the model and addressed a redispatch design question. The results displayed the following implications from order types in redispatch markets with multi-period all-or-none design: (1) The order design provides few risks for market parties, as orders are fully cleared. (2) Large orders may lead to dispatch ramps before and after the delivery period and may cause ‚Äúramp-risk‚Äù mark-ups as well as additional trading of imbalances on intra-day. (3) All-or-none design in a liquid situation leads to the over-procurement of redispatch by the grid operator, as orders cannot be partially activated. Moreover, it is likely that the grid operator induces imbalances to the system by ‚Äúincomplete‚Äù redispatch activation (i.e. upward and downward redispatch volumes are not equal).},

The model structure, its components, and linkages are presented in detail; an additional case study demonstrates the capability of our sociotechnical model. We find that changes in the political framework cannot be mapped directly to {RES} operators as behaviour of intermediary market actors has to be considered as well. Characteristics and strategies of intermediaries are thus an important factor for successful {RES} marketing and further deployment. It is shown that the model is able to assess the emergence and stability of market niches.},

	abstract = {This article introduces and describes {OPERA}, a new technology-rich bottom-up energy system optimization model for the Netherlands. We give a detailed specification of {OPERA}‚Äôs underlying methodology and approach, as well as a description of its multiple applications. The model has been used extensively to formulate strategic policy advice on energy decarbonization and climate change mitigation for the Dutch government, and to perform exploratory studies on the role of specific low-carbon energy technologies in the energy transition of the Netherlands. Based on a reference scenario established through extensive consultation with industry and the public sector, {OPERA} allows for examining the impact of autonomous technology diffusion and energy efficiency improvement processes, and investigating a broad range of policy interventions that target greenhouse gas emission abatement or air pollution reduction, amongst others. Two characteristics that render {OPERA} particularly useful are the fact that (1) it covers the entire energy system and all greenhouse gas emissions of the Netherlands, and (2) it possesses a high temporal resolution, including a module for flexibly handling individual time units. The simulation of the complete Dutch energy system and the ability to represent energy supply and demand on an hourly basis allow for making balanced judgments on how to best accommodate large amounts of variable renewable energy production. {OPERA} is therefore particularly suited for analyzing subjects in the field of system integration, which makes it an ideal tool for assessing the implementation of the energy transition and the establishment of a low-carbon economy. We outline several near-term developments and opportunities for future improvements and refinements of {OPERA}. One of {OPERA}‚Äôs attractive features is that its structure can readily be applied to other countries, notably in Europe, and could thus relatively easily be extended to cover the entire European Union.},

A novel iron-air battery characterized by high performance, safety and reliability for operation at intermediate temperatures (500‚Äì650‚ÄØ¬∞C) is demonstrated. The iron-air rechargeable battery is based on a new configuration where both the nickel-electrode and the hydrogen/water redox processes, generally utilized in high temperature ceramic batteries, are avoided in this system completely operating in the solid state. This can increase the durability and reliability of the battery while providing excellent performance (specific energy of 0.46‚ÄØWh‚ÄØg‚àí1, specific capacity of 0.5‚ÄØAh‚ÄØg‚àí1, faradaic efficiency 80\%). These characteristics favourably compare to low temperature iron-air batteries. Excellent performance and cyclability are achieved at 650‚ÄØ¬∞C for the iron-air solid-state battery showing no relevant degradation after more than 100 cycles. The concept is based on a composite iron-ceria anode in contact with an oxygen anion-conducting lanthanum gallate electrolyte and a mixed conductivity lanthanum ferrite perovskite-based cathode. This combines both simplicity of operation and intrinsic safety with high energy density and durability. The excellent dynamic behaviour, the absence of influence of external environmental conditions and the use of cost-effective ceramic materials, with the possibility to produce high quality heat to cover the chain of electrical and thermal energy, make such systems largely appealing for applications related to renewable power sources.},

Experts are conceived of as unreflexive, but lay public actors as reflexive. To provide a concrete grounding for this claim, this paper offers a conceptual analysis of Brian Wynne's work on the public understanding of science. Wynne's work intersects theorizing about late modernity (explored via a comparison with Beck's and Giddens') and debates about the role of experts and the public in decision-making (explored via a comparison to Collins and Evans). I show that Wynne's work, as with Beck's and Giddens', and Collins and Evans', embodies different conceptions of lay actors. In Wynne's work ambivalence arises concerning whether social identities or social relationships ground the theoretical account. I suggest the tension arises because of the general desire of the social science analyst to preserve the autonomy of the lay actor.},

The analysis identifies several substantive factors which influence the credibility of scientific communication. Starting from the now-accepted point that public uptake of science depends primarily upon the trust and credibility public groups are prepared to invest in scientific institutions and representatives, the paper observes that these are contingent upon the social relationships and identities which people feel to be affected by scientific knowledge, which never comes free of social interests or implications. The case study shows laypeople capable of extensive informal reflection upon their social relationships towards scientific experts, and on the epistemological status of their own `local' knowledge in relation to `outside' knowledge. Public uptake of science might be improved if scientific institutions expressed an equivalent reflexive discourse in the public domain.},

For a long time, people have argued that social science issues should be given more prominence in engineering curricula. More to the point, social studies of technology have repeatedly observed how important the understanding of the social world is to successful engineering.

The science of loss and damage has evolved with the development of extreme event attribution science, which assesses the probability of an extreme event being influenced by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, but loss and damage still suffers from the lack of a clear definition and measurability and is further complicated by debates on climate justice and shared but differentiated responsibilities.

We provide such analysis for 176 countries and found a strong (rs = -0.798;95\%{CI} -0.852, -0.727) and significant (p{\textless}0.0001) relationship between the distribution of climate risk and toxic pollution. We also found that inequities in pollution production, economic status, and institutional readiness are interconnected and exacerbate risk for countries already in the highest risk categories for both toxic and non-toxic (greenhouse gas) pollution. The findings have policy implications, including the use of the proposed Target assessment to decide where best to address toxic and non-toxic pollution simultaneously, based on the need to minimize human suffering and maximize return on effort.},

This paper bridges a gap between the influence of geopolitical risks relating to energy and international tensions by analyzing micro-level operational measures. We deploy an empirical model to predict the energy sector and possible risk factors incorporating Eurostat data on twenty-seven states, from 2011 to 2020. This study collected a different energy variable to support the multiple regression model constructed by the ‚Äúblocks‚Äù (hierarchical linear regression) method. The results suggest that geopolitical risks cause adverse effects on both the energy and other corporate sectors. The future direction of this research is to estimate how statistical model relationships may assist the corporate sector, and investors, in adopting mitigating measures to control upcoming geopolitical risks due to energy risks caused by geopolitical unrest.},

Recognition justice has a distinct status compared to the other two as its meaning seems the least tangible to grasp. In this article, a systematic literature study was conducted to the definitions and interpretations of recognition justice, showing that the concept currently refers to a large variety of phenomena. This diversity obscures what ‚Äúrecognition justice‚Äù actually measures. This paper aims to revisit the concept of recognition justice in energy justice by asking the following question: what does the tenet of recognition justice refer to, taking into account the philosophical roots of the concept? To do so, key texts from Axel Honneth and Nancy Fraser were studied in-depth, resulting in four main insights: (1) there are two approaches to recognition justice; (2) actors can be (mis)recognised in multiple ways; (3) two different yet complementary methods for identifying instances of misrecognition can be distinguished; and (4) recognition justice cannot be reduced to other tenets of justice. These findings cumulate in a revisited definition of recognition justice as concerned with the adequate recognition of all actors through love, law, and status order. This definition structures the large variety of understandings in the scholarship, and it has the potential to provide a more fine-grained explanation of energy controversies, which advances the ultimate aim of making energy systems and policies more just.},

Despite a recent emphasis of research on agent-based modelling and on energy transitions, an overview of how the methodology may be of value to understanding transition processes is still missing from the literature. This systematic review evaluates the potential of agent-based modelling to understanding energy transitions from a social-scientific perspective, based on a set of 62 articles. Six topic areas were identified, addressing different components of the energy system: Electricity Market, Consumption Dynamics/ Consumer Behaviour, Policy and Planning, New Technologies/ Innovation, Energy System, Transitions. Distribution of articles across topic areas was indicative of a continuing interest in electricity market related enquiries, and an increasing number of studies in the realm of policy and planning. Based on the relevance of energy transition specific complexities to the choice of {ABM} as a methodology, four complexity categories (1‚Äì4) were identified. Indicating the degree of association between the complexity of energy transitions and {ABM}‚Äôs ability to address these, the categorisation revealed that 35 of the 62 studies directly linked the choice of {ABM} to energy transition complexities (complexity category 1) or were set in the context of energy transitions (complexity category 2). The review further showed that the greatest potential contribution of {ABM} to energy transition studies lies in its practical application to decision-making in policy and planning. More interdisciplinary collaboration in model development is recommended to address the discrepancy between the relevance of social factors to modelling energy transitions and the ability of the social sciences to make effective use of {ABM}.},

	abstract = {The aim of this review is to discuss how quantitative modelling of energy scenarios for sustainable energy transition pathways can be made more realistic by taking into account insights from the socio-technical and related literatures. The proposition is that an enriched modelling approach would focus not just on technology development and deployment, but also on feedback loops, learning processes, policy and governance, behavioural changes, the interlinkages between the energy sector and other economic sectors, and infrastructure development. The review discusses a range of socio-technical concepts with a view to how they can enrich the understanding and modelling of highly complex dynamic systems such as flexible energy systems with high shares of variable renewable energy. In this context, application of system dynamics modelling ({SDM}) for the analysis of energy transitions is also introduced by describing the differences between {SDM} and a traditional modelling approach that uses econometric and linear programming methods. A conceptual framework for this type of modelling is provided by using causal loop diagrams. The diagrams illustrate the endogenous approach of {SDM} ‚Äì understanding and modelling the structure of a system, which is responsible for its dynamic behaviour. {SDM} can also capture the co-evolution of economic, policy, technology, and behavioural factors over sufficiently long time periods, which is necessary for the analysis of transition pathway dynamics. In this regard, the review summarises how socio-technical concepts can be approached in {SDM} and why they are relevant for the analysis of flexibility in energy systems. From a computational point of view, it could be beneficial to combine {SDM} with technologically detailed energy system optimization models and that could be a way forward for achieving more realistic, non-linear quantitative modelling of sustainable energy transitions.},

Therefore explaining energy transitions requires combining insights from disciplines investigating these factors. The existing literature is not consistent in identifying these disciplines nor proposing how they can be combined. We conceptualize national energy transitions as a co-evolution of three types of systems: energy flows and markets, energy technologies, and energy-related policies. The focus on the three types of systems gives rise to three perspectives on national energy transitions: techno-economic with its roots in energy systems analysis and various domains of economics; socio-technical with its roots in sociology of technology, {STS}, and evolutionary economics; and political with its roots in political science. We use the three perspectives as an organizing principle to propose a meta-theoretical framework for analyzing national energy transitions. Following Elinor Ostrom's approach, the proposed framework explains national energy transitions through a nested conceptual map of variables and theories. In comparison with the existing meta-theoretical literature, the three perspectives framework elevates the role of political science since policies are likely to be increasingly prominent in shaping 21st century energy transitions.},

	abstract = {The varied effects of recent extreme weather events around the world exemplify the uneven impacts of climate change on populations, even within relatively small geographic regions. Differential human vulnerability to environmental hazards results from a range of social, economic, historical, and political factors, all of which operate at multiple scales. While adaptation to climate change has been the dominant focus of policy and research agendas, it is essential to ask as well why some communities and peoples are disproportionately exposed to and affected by climate threats. The cases and synthesis presented here are organized around four key themes (resource access, governance, culture, and knowledge), which we approach from four social science fields (cultural anthropology, archaeology, human geography, and sociology). Social scientific approaches to human vulnerability draw vital attention to the root causes of climate change threats and the reasons that people are forced to adapt to them. Because vulnerability is a multidimensional process rather than an unchanging state, a dynamic social approach to vulnerability is most likely to improve mitigation and adaptation planning efforts.

Because the impacts are most acutely felt in local communities, it is critical to improve understanding of the response options that are available for and being chosen by communities. We conducted a mixed methods analysis of case studies reporting community-based responses to climate change hazards. Based on content analysis of published case studies, we generated an emergent evidence-based typology of such responses according to their nature and goals. Using this typology, we quantitatively analysed more than 1500 response examples and determined the patterns with which community-level climate change adaptation and disaster mitigation strategies vary across world regions and across economic and governance conditions. Specifically, diversity of responses is lower in developing countries, and implementation of local-level policy and planning responses is less frequent in countries characterised by low governance quality. Our results confirm that, although there is much that local communities can do to respond to the challenges of climate change, there is also a need for increased support of local activities. By synthesising data from many local studies, our research provides a first global evidence base for local-level climate change adaptation policy.},

The existing literature highlights the importance of systemic risk induced by climate change, but there are still deficiencies in understanding its dynamics and assessing the risk. Aiming to bridge this gap, this study develops a theoretical framework and employs two cases to illustrate the concept, origin, occurrence, propagation, evolution, and assessment framework of systemic risk induced by climate change. The key findings include: 1) systemic risk induced by climate change derives from the rapid growth of greenhouse gas emissions, increasingly complex connections among different socioeconomic systems, and continuous changes in exposure and vulnerability; 2) systemic risk induced by climate change is a holistic risk generated by the interconnection, interaction, and dynamic evolution of different types of single risks, and its fundamental, defining feature is cascading effects. The extent of risk propagation and its duration depend on the characteristics of the various discrete risks that are connected to make up the systemic risk; 3) impact domains, severity of impact, and probability of occurrences are three core indicators in systemic risk assessment, and the impact domains should include the economy, society, homeland security, human health, and living conditions. We propose to deepen systemic risk research from three aspects: to develop theories to understand the mechanism of systemic risk; to conduct empirical research to assess future risks; and to develop countermeasures to mitigate the risk.},

	abstract = {The notion of disproportionate impacts of climate change on certain groups and regions has long been a part of policy debates and scientific inquiry, and was instrumental to the emergence of the ‚ÄúLoss and Damage‚Äù (L\&D) policy agenda in international negotiations on climate change. Yet, ‚Äòdisproportionality‚Äô remains relatively undefined and implicit in science on loss and damage from climate change. A coherent theoretical basis of disproportionality is needed for advancing science and policy on loss and damage. It is necessary to ask: What is disproportionate, to whom, and in relation to what? We critically examine the uses of disproportionality in loss and damage scholarship by analyzing how disproportionality is treated in the literature conceptually, methodologically, and empirically. We review publications against a set of criteria derived from seminal work on disproportionality in other fields, mainly environmental justice and disaster studies that have analyzed environment‚Äìsociety interactions. We find disproportionality to be dynamic and multidimensional, spanning the themes of risks, impacts, and burdens. Our results show that while the concept is often used in loss and damage scholarship, its use relies on unarticulated notions of justice and often lacks conceptual, methodological and empirical grounding. Disproportionality also appears as a boundary concept, enabling critical and multiscalar explorations of historical processes that shape the uneven impacts of climate change, alongside social justice and normative claims for desired futures. This emerging area of science offers an opportunity to critically re-evaluate the conceptualization of the relationship between climate-change-related impacts, development, and inequality.

	abstract = {The concept of risk is a key aspect of how the {IPCC} assesses and communicates to decision-makers the
potential adverse impacts of, and response options to, climate change.
The use of the concept of risk has not been fully consistent across Working Groups or between
assessment cycles, given that the concept itself and its use by {IPCC} has continued to evolve. Since the
Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5{¬∫C}, cross-Working Group efforts have been put in place to
develop a consistent risk framing throughout the subsequent products of {IPCCs} Sixth Assessment Cycle
({AR}6).
The purpose of this guidance note is to promote a more consistent and transparent application of the
concept of risk across Working Groups in the sixth assessment cycle and to provide the foundation for
its use and possible further evolution in future assessment cycles.
This guidance note seeks to maximise consistency among Working Groups while recognising
differences in how the concept of risk is used across scientific disciplines and relevant literature.
Consistent use of the concept of risk is intended to provide a more robust, clear and transparent basis
for communicating climate change-related risks and risk management options to decision-makers
working in a wide range of institutional and policy settings.
The scope of this guidance is relatively narrow. This document merely seeks to clarify how the term
‚Äòrisk‚Äô should be used where and when authors consider it appropriate to use this concept within their
assessment ‚Äì it does not propose an overarching risk-centred framework for assessment of climate
change impacts and responses in {IPCC} reports in order not to preclude consideration of beneficial
consequences from impacts or responses.},

The heat index, which measures how the temperature actually feels on the body, would hit 126 degrees by the time the day was over. Meteorologists had been warning residents about a two-day heat wave, but these temperatures did not end that soon. When the heat wave broke a week later, city streets had buckled; the records for electrical use were shattered; and power grids had failed, leaving residents without electricity for up to two days. And by July 20, over seven hundred people had perished-more than twice the number that died in the Chicago Fire of 1871, twenty times the number of those struck by Hurricane Andrew in 1992‚Äîin the great Chicago heat wave, one of the deadliest in American history.

Heat waves in the United States kill more people during a typical year than all other natural disasters combined. Until now, no one could explain either the overwhelming number or the heartbreaking manner of the deaths resulting from the 1995 Chicago heat wave. Meteorologists and medical scientists have been unable to account for the scale of the trauma, and political officials have puzzled over the sources of the city's vulnerability. In Heat Wave, Eric Klinenberg takes us inside the anatomy of the metropolis to conduct what he calls a "social autopsy," examining the social, political, and institutional organs of the city that made this urban disaster so much worse than it ought to have been},

The paper identifies three main channels through which the inequality-aggravating effect of climate change materializes, namely (a) increase in the exposure of the disadvantaged groups to the adverse effects of climate change; (b) increase in their susceptibility to damage caused by climate change; and (c) decrease in their ability to cope and recover from the damage suffered. The paper presents evidence to illustrate each of the processes above.

In response, state and local governments have developed solar equity programs, primarily focused on increasing adoption by low- and moderate-income ({LMI}) households. This study merged national datasets that estimate rooftop solar potential, the distribution of rooftop solar systems, and census tract- level socioeconomic and demographic characteristics to answer three questions. First, how are spatial distributions of rooftop potential and penetration similar and different across cities? Second, how is rooftop penetration distributed across non-{LMI} and {LMI} communities in different cities? Third, how do the relationships between rooftop penetration and local socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, identified as barriers to solar adoption, differ? Using {GIS}, bivariate and multivariate analyses, these questions were examined in four {US} cities ‚Äì Riverside and San Bernardino, California, Washington, {DC}, and Chicago, Illinois ‚Äì to understand both universal and distinct local manifestations. Findings include: higher rooftop potential existed in some {LMI} communities; higher rooftop potential did not necessarily translate to higher rooftop penetration, especially if higher potential was in {LMI} communities; and beyond income, other socioeconomic and demographic characteristics such as race/ethnicity, limited English proficiency, age of housing stock, and internet access were associated with rooftop penetration. While there remains great potential for expanding rooftop solar to {LMI} households and communities, understanding the local dynamics of solar potential and penetration may inform better policy development and implementation.},

We find 769 of these entities have net zero targets, but only 152 meet minimum criteria for robustness, including timing, status, coverage, use of offsets, and governance. Though net zero is now widespread as a concept, its operationalization is still in its infancy. Making net zero targets robust should now be a priority for policymakers in order to deliver Paris-consistent action, as well as securing more ambitious targets.Key policy {insightsNet} zero targets now cover two-thirds of the global economy, but robust net zero targets only cover around five percent.Strengthening targets and their implementation is particularly needed in the following areas: target status (including setting targets into law); coveraneuge of activities; limits to and transparency regarding the use of offsets; and publication of plans and of progress reports.Policymakers should aim to strengthen net zero targets by setting standards for robust net zero targets; building the capacity of entities, particularly those in the global South, to meet the technical and resource challenges required to effectively operationalize net zero emission targets.},

	abstract = {Many countries have implemented national climate policies to accomplish pledged Nationally Determined Contributions and to contribute to the temperature objectives of the Paris Agreement¬†on climate change. In 2023, the global stocktake will assess the combined effort of countries. Here, based on a public policy database and a multi-model scenario analysis, we show that implementation of current policies leaves a median emission gap of 22.4 to 28.2 {GtCO}2eq by 2030¬†with the optimal pathways to implement the well below 2‚Äâ¬∞C and 1.5‚Äâ¬∞C¬†Paris goals. If Nationally Determined Contributions would be fully implemented, this gap would be reduced by a third. Interestingly, the countries evaluated were found to not achieve their pledged contributions with implemented policies (implementation gap), or to have an ambition gap with optimal pathways towards well below 2 ¬∞C. This shows that all countries would need to accelerate the implementation of policies for renewable technologies, while efficiency improvements are especially important in emerging countries and fossil-fuel-dependent countries., To evaluate the effectiveness of current national policies in achieving global temperature targets is important but a systematic multi-model evaluation is still lacking. Here the authors identified a reduction of 3.5 {GtCO}2 eq of current national policies relative to a baseline scenario without climate policies by 2030 due to the increasing low carbon share of final energy and the improving final energy intensity.},

	abstract = {The Paris targets are based on assumptions that a global temperature increase of 1.5¬†¬∞C‚àí2¬†¬∞C above preindustrial levels will be safe, and that the climate can be stabilized at these higher temperatures. However, global average temperatures are already measurably impacting the Earth‚Äôs systems at 1.2¬†¬∞C above preindustrial levels. Many human and environmental systems cannot adapt to higher temperatures, which may exceed critical tipping points in physical climate and ecological systems. Compounding these risks is the likelihood that the international 2¬†¬∞C limit will be overshot due to political obstacles and systemic inertia from existing greenhouse gases, warming oceans, and the decades required to replace existing infrastructure. Moreover, the Earth energy imbalance may have to be reduced to approximately zero to stabilize the global climate (i.e., {CO}2 concentrations lowered to around 350¬†ppm.) Most {IPCC} mitigation scenarios assume that climate targets will be temporarily overshot, and require large-scale carbon dioxide removal [{CDR}] to subsequently lower temperatures. However, many {CDR} methods may not be politically and/or technologically feasible, and they will act too slowly to prevent dangerous overshoot. These issues raise serious doubts about the ability of current mitigation polices to ensure safe outcomes. They also indicate the need to investigate whether rapid climate cooling measures may be required to reduce the risks associated with high temperatures during the long time it will take to decarbonize the global economy and stabilize the climate. Given the uncertainty of future mitigation success, and the potentially existential costs of failure, there is now an urgent need to examine whether or not current efforts are credible, and if not, what mitigation measures will be required to prevent dangerous overshoot and ensure a safe, stable climate. In order to develop a feasible mitigation strategy, it will be necessary to prioritize research both on climate overshoot risks, and on the relative effectiveness, risks, costs and timelines of potential mitigation and adaptation approaches. Since large scale climate interventions will be needed to prevent dangerous global warming, all plausible options need to be investigated, including carbon dioxide removal methods and technologies for rapidly cooling global temperatures. This research is a prerequisite for evaluating the comparative benefits, costs and risks of using, or not using, various forms of mitigation and adaptation, and then developing a realistic overshoot risk management plan.},

Research has shown that the distribution of low-carbon technology subsidies and their associated benefits can be highly uneven across socioeconomic groups, revealing a persistent inequality issue. Yet this research has tended to focus almost exclusively on adoption of technologies at the household-level, with limited insights into whether and how this distribution might differ in the case of community energy. To address this, this paper quantitatively investigates the distribution of payments to household- and community-level energy systems across socioeconomic groups in Scotland under the {UK} government feed-in-tariff. Analysis is conducted on a novel dataset of 26,218 household and community wind and solar installations across 6,976 micro-level data-zones using a combination of distributional analysis and random effects within-between regression. It finds that feed-in-tariff payments for household-level wind and solar {PV} systems have heavily benefitted more affluent socioeconomic groups, while payments to community energy projects have flowed more consistently into areas of higher deprivation, particularly in the case of community solar. These findings suggest that community energy has been successful in bringing the benefits of low-carbon technologies to areas of lower income and higher deprivation, with important lessons for policymakers concerned with a just transition going forward.},

This paper therefore undertakes a whole-system approach and explores optimal pathways towards 100\% renewable energy by 2050. The analysis is carried out for Ireland, which currently has the highest share of variable renewable electricity on a synchronous power system. Large numbers of scenarios are developed using the Irish {TIMES} model to address uncertainties. Results show that compared to decarbonization targets, focusing on renewable penetration without considering carbon capture options is significantly less cost effective in carbon mitigation. Alternative assumptions on bioenergy imports and maximum variability in power generation lead to very different energy mixes in bioenergy and electrification levels. All pathways suggest that indigenous bioenergy needs to be fully exploited and the current annual deployment rate of renewable electricity needs a boost. Pathways relying on international bioenergy imports are slightly cheaper and faces less economic and technical challenges. However, given the large future uncertainties, it is recommended that further policy considerations be given to pathways with high electrification levels as they are more robust towards uncertainties.},

	abstract = {In energy-only electricity markets, such as Australia‚Äôs National Electricity Market ({NEM}), it has been argued that an increasing penetration of variable renewable energy ({VRE}) generation is likely to have two effects: (i) more extreme spot prices, with greater instances of both very high and very low prices and (ii) a need to increase the market price cap ({MPC}) and related price signals for reliability. This article examines the validity of both these effects using spot pricing outcomes in South Australia ({SA}), which has one of the highest {VRE} penetrations worldwide. We find partial support for these two effects. While extremely low prices have become more frequent over time, extremely high prices have become less frequent. Spot price volatility has risen, consistent with the hypothesis, but not because prices have become more extreme. Furthermore, these findings are observed for prices in all {NEM} regions, not just {SA}. Also, reliability has remained high over the past decade despite the {MPC} remaining constant in real terms. We provide four reasons why higher {VRE} penetration need not result in more extreme prices and higher {MPCs}: (i) greater investment in volatility-dampening, reliability-enhancing technologies like storage and interconnectors; (ii) increased contract cover; (iii) more price-responsive demand; and (iv) emergence of additional ancillary service revenues. These findings have implications for the durability of the {NEM}‚Äôs energy-only design given expected further increases in {VRE} penetration rates across the {NEM}.},

This debate has led to a wide range of technical reports seeking to quantify the costs and benefits of solar energy to electric utilities, ratepayers, and society at large. We review these studies, discuss the different perspectives that they represent, and identify the key variables that have shaped this value-of-solar debate.

Urban heat islands ({UHI}) can exacerbate these adverse impacts in cities by amplifying heat exposure during the day and inhibiting the body‚Äôs ability to recover at night. Since the {UHI} intensity varies not only across, but also within cities, intra-city variation may lead to differential impact of urban heat stress on different demographic groups. To examine these differential impacts, we combine satellite observations with census data to evaluate the relationship between distributions of both {UHI} and income at the neighborhood scale for 25 cities around the world. We find that in most (72\%) cases, poorer neighborhoods experience elevated heat exposure, an incidental consequence of the intra-city distribution of income in cities. This finding suggests that policymakers should consider designing city-specific {UHI} reduction strategies to mitigate its impacts on the most socioeconomically vulnerable populations who may be less equipped to adapt to environmental stressors. Since the strongest contributor of intra-urban {UHI} variability among the physical characteristics considered in this study is a neighborhood‚Äôs vegetation density, increasing green space in lower income neighborhoods is one strategy urban policymakers can adopt to ameliorate some of {UHI}‚Äôs inequitable burden on economically disadvantaged residents.},

This approach helps us identify local and regional priorities and support the development of new relationships for adaptation research and planning by helping to diagnose barriers to climate change adaptation, assist improved communication through framing/reframing climate issues based on shared understandings and collective learning, and help move from conflict to cooperation through better negotiation of diverse worldviews.},

To this end, a new U.S. consumer survey probes core attitudes about the reliability, affordability and environmental impact of energy. Appended quarterly to the long-running monthly survey of 500 households that produces the Index of Consumer Sentiment, this instrument inherits the sample design and statistical rigor of that household economic survey. First-year results yield several notable findings. Home energy bills are viewed as unaffordable if they were to double for consumers in the lower income tercile but only if they were to triple for consumers in the upper income tercile. Regarding the cost increases deemed unaffordable, consumers report much greater sensitivity to higher gasoline prices than to higher home energy bills. Moreover, consumers express at least as much concern about the environmental impact of energy as they do about its affordability, a result that shows some regional variation but which holds across income brackets. Several other findings are of likely interest to energy researchers and policymakers, and the unique data series generated by this survey will enable deeper analyses of attitudinally related energy topics as time goes on.},

We differentiate between wind energy, solar energy, and biomass energy; natural gas is used as a reference category. We measure protest intentions and acceptance regarding the construction of new power plants within a 10-kilometer radius of respondents‚Äô place of residence. Protest and acceptance are explained by several competing theoretical determinants such as specific attitudes towards each energy source, general attitudes towards climate change, social norms, the ‚Äúnot-in-my-backyard‚Äù phenomenon, place attachment, and conditional cooperation. We use decomposition models used in labor market research to study endowment, discrimination, and characteristics effects related to different attitudinal dimensions and their influence on acceptance and protest intentions. Our results show more positive attitudes, less protest intentions, and a stronger acceptance of solar energy, followed by wind energy, biomass energy, and natural gas. Theory comparison reveals, for instance, that ‚Äúnot-in-my-backyard‚Äù beliefs have high explanatory power, climate change concern is only relevant for the acceptance of wind energy and solar energy, and place attachment seems to be a useful concept for explaining protest intentions. The decomposition models indicate that attitudes are strong determinants of acceptance and protest intentions where, in addition to endowment effects, we also find some indications of discrimination effects (i.e., different weights of attitudinal dimensions) and characteristics effects (i.e., effects of respondents‚Äô characteristics). Finally, we discuss the policy implications of these results.},

Shared ownership presumes that company and community actors have common goals, can form effective partnerships and negotiate fair outcomes. But there is a lack of research on shared ownership, in particular, how it is constructed by different actors, and the role of trust in shaping practice. This study addressed this gap, drawing on qualitative data from in-depth interviews with 19 {UK} stakeholders from industry, community and advisory backgrounds. Thematic analysis revealed strong support for shared ownership in principle, but significant challenges in practice. Actors held different rationales and contrasting views on whether the policy should be discretionary or mandatory. A lack of trust was prevalent, with developers expressing skepticism regarding the capacities and representativeness of community actors; and community actors viewing developers as solely motivated by profit, instrumentally using communities to gain planning consent. We conclude that for shared ownership to become conventional practice, it will be necessary to provide mechanisms that facilitate partner identification at an early stage, which can help to build relations of trust between actors, within a more stable and supportive policy context.},

This mixed methods study employed in-depth interviews (n=54) and surveys (n=252) with multiple stakeholder groups to understand perceptions of procedural justice across two Canadian provinces. We compared Ontario ‚Äì which has built a strong base of wind energy capacity using technocratic siting procedures with Nova Scotia ‚Äì which has anchored its development strategy more explicitly with a community-based program. We find stronger levels of perceived procedural justice in Nova Scotia across the majority of principles tested. In Ontario, opposition to local developments was highly conflated with a lack of procedural justice including few opportunities to take part in siting. Across both provinces however, specific aspects of planning processes ‚Äì mostly related to ‚Äòthe ability to affect the outcome‚Äô ‚Äì were strong predictors of local approval of wind.

Here, we examine the results of a 2013 mail survey of individuals residing in the vicinity of a 2MW wind turbine that is located on the edge of the historic coastal town of Lewes, Delaware in the United States, and adjacent to Delaware Bay and the Great Marsh Preserve. The wind turbine, which was constructed in 2010, primarily serves the University of Delaware's coastal campus, and to a lesser extent the town of Lewes. Seventy-eight percent hold positive or very positive attitudes toward the wind turbine, with only 10\% having negative or very negative attitudes, and 82\% like the look of the wind turbine. Socially constructed aspects find more resonance than physical ones (e.g., attractiveness) in explaining this latter finding, with the wind turbine being reflective of a transformation to a clean energy future for those residents who like the way the turbine looks. On the other hand, those objecting to its look, find the turbine does not fit the landscape. Policy implications of these findings and others related to wind turbine sound are considered, and recommendations for better understanding of proposed developments from the vantage point of the affected communities, including how a community views itself and its surrounding landscape, are made.},

It is a collection of best papers presented at an international research conference held in Tramelan (Switzerland) in February 2006. While there are ambitious government targets to increase the share of renewable energy in many countries, it is increasingly recognized that social acceptance may be a constraining factor in achieving this target. This is particularly apparent in the case of wind energy, which has become a subject of contested debates in several countries largely due to its visual impact on landscapes. This paper introduces three dimensions of social acceptance, namely socio-political, community and market acceptance. Factors influencing socio-political and community acceptance are increasingly recognized as being important for understanding the apparent contradictions between general public support for renewable energy innovation and the difficult realization of specific projects. The third dimension, market acceptance, has received less attention so far and provides opportunities for further research, particularly from management scholars.},

Two dimensions of trust are relevant in this respect: competence-based and integrity-based trust. Yet, the unique and interaction effects of these two dimensions of trust on project acceptability are not well understood. We conducted two experimental studies to test these effects in China and the Netherlands. As expected, higher integrity-based trust in responsible agents led to higher project acceptability in both countries. Notably, these effects were independent of the level of competence-based trust. Competence-based trust enhanced project acceptability only in China and only when integrity-based trust was low. Mediation analyses further showed that (part of) the effects of both dimensions of trust on project acceptability could be explained by people's perceptions of how the decisions were made, in both countries. Results suggest that integrity-based trust has a more profound effect on project acceptability.},

	abstract = {The low carbon transition is fraught with challenges for policy makers, not least the social acceptance of large-scale infrastructure. In response to community objections, the distribution of benefit funds has become increasingly prevalent as a means to bolster acceptance. However, little research has investigated the spatiality of benefit provision - where boundaries are drawn that define the ‚Äòlocality‚Äô of a project and who is eligible to benefit. Using a high voltage power line in Ireland as a case study, this paper investigates how the boundaries of the community fund were identified, contested, negotiated and implemented. It draws on a qualitative dataset comprising secondary materials, observation and in-depth interviews with the stakeholders administering the fund and both successful and unsuccessful community applicants. Stakeholders justified boundary setting as essential for efficient and equitable fund distribution, founded upon discourses of impact and proximity. Those administering the fund mixed objectivity and subjectivity, departing from a logical, formulaic approach to identify the locality of the project before revising it in response to ‚Äòreasonable‚Äô local knowledge and interests. The outcome was a boundary that was widely acknowledged to be imperfect, yet legitimate and fair. Community groups recognised the fund both as an instrumental tool to secure their acceptance and as a means to mitigate impact and share benefit, provided it served their interests. Application of the boundary in fund decision-making revealed inherent difficulties in putting abstract definitions of ‚Äòlocality‚Äô into practice as well as tensions between values of meritocracy and distributional equity. We discuss the applicability of the findings to non-linear energy projects (e.g. wind farms) and propose recommendations to optimise legitimacy and fairness in drawing boundaries for community benefit provision.},

Spatial decision-support tools are being developed and applied to tackle some of these challenges by facilitating systematic identification of suitable development sites based on technical, environmental and socio-economic criteria. Nevertheless, decision-support tools are often developed with limited input from stakeholders affecting participative and accountable planning and decision-making. This paper aims to address this shortcoming and foster greater transparency in the development of support tools for renewable energy planning, and thus in siting decisions. It present and discusses a stakeholder-driven approach to the co-creation of an online decision-support tool that attends to planning policy, technical considerations, environmental protection and social concerns influencing renewable energy planning decisions in Ireland. This bottom-up approach, easily transferable to other jurisdictions, fosters proactive expert input, awareness raising and greater comprehensibility and acceptance of siting decisions. It also enables developing an interface that responds to users‚Äô needs. The paper contributes to advancing renewable energy planning practice through effective and meaningful stakeholder engagement that supports transparent and accountable decisions from the outset. It also highlights ongoing data and technological shortcomings affecting the integration and operationalisation of stakeholders demands and needs, which signal priority areas of action to further advance the development of renewable energy decision-support tools.},

To suggest how it can do so, we analyze existing state- and county-level siting processes in Washington state, finding that both fall short on measures of procedural justice. To overcome this limitation and address the tension between procedural justice and project development, we then propose a collaborative governance approach to wind facility siting, in which state governments retain ultimate authority over permitting decisions but encourage and support local-level deliberations as the primary means of making those decisions. Such an approach, we argue, would be more just, facilitate wind development by addressing community concerns constructively and result in better projects through the input of diverse stakeholders.},

While the transition towards {RES}-based energy systems is largely perceived positively in general, locally both {RES} and grid expansion are often confronted with a lack of public acceptance. Using Germany as a case study, we analyse public acceptance of energy infrastructure and its main drivers on local vs. national levels. For this purpose, we conducted a nationally representative survey. Our results show that, on a national level, the acceptance of {RES} is very high and there is also a high acceptance of grid expansion if it helps to increase the share of {RES} in the system. In terms of local acceptance problems that may arise for most considered technologies, concerns about landscape modification turn out to be the main driving factor. Moreover, the distance between places of residence and places of energy infrastructure construction is crucial. While acceptance or rejection of technologies will never be entirely tangible or explicable, we find the explicability of rejections to be lowest for new technologies. Finally, age and education turn out to be the most relevant socio-demographic variables determining the participants' acceptance.},

To date, social acceptance is often considered only in the final stage of the planning process, if at all. It will be argued that acceptance-relevant factors should be integrated during the whole process in order to include the public and coordinate acceptance and planning in combination. In order to achieve this, a social gap in the planning of complex energy infrastructure needs to be closed. The social gap presents itself in a twofold manner: one issue is the critical analysis of the general measurability of acceptance factors referring to the question if it is possible to operationalize and predict social acceptance reliably. The second ‚Äúgap‚Äù refers to the lack of integration of results from acceptance research into current planning procedures. Taking wind farm planning as an example, the two gaps are discussed and a new, integrative planning model is advocated. Finally, requirements for a user-centered planning procedure are derived.},

	abstract = {Public participation in decision making has been widely advocated by scholars and practitioners as a remedy for public resistance against sustainable energy projects. Yet, it is unclear via which processes public participation in decision making may affect public acceptability of energy projects. We hypothesize that public participation in decision making is likely to increase project acceptability when it enhances perceived procedural fairness. Moreover, we hypothesize that perceived procedural fairness is higher when people can participate and influence major rather than only minor aspects of the project. We conducted three experimental studies in the Netherlands to test these hypotheses, with renewable energy projects as a case in point. As expected, public participation in decision making increased perceived procedural fairness, particularly when people could influence major aspects of the project. In turn, higher perceived procedural fairness enhanced public acceptability of the projects. Interestingly, when controlling for perceived procedural fairness, public participation in decision making had no effect (Study 2) and even a negative effect (Study 1 and 3) on project acceptability, particularly when people could influence major aspects. We conclude that public participation in decision making can enhance project acceptability if people can influence major aspects and perceive the decision making as fair. Next, our findings point out that there may be other processes instigated by public participation in decision making that can influence project acceptability. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.},

Nonetheless, this literature often assumes rather than demonstrates that the forms of governance it promotes are more democratic than the status quo. This analysis contributes to the emerging field of {ED} by assessing the complex and varied ways in which communities in Scotland practise energy governance. By focusing on three key governance processes (decision-making, accountability and dispute resolution), the importance of local contexts for the establishment and negotiation of democratic practices is demonstrated. This local specificity, however, also raises further questions regarding the universal applicability of the {ED} concept.},

	abstract = {To achieve a successful energy transition, it is vital to integrate citizens‚Äô needs into government policies through participatory processes. However,offline participatory approaches can be overly intensive which leads to an over-representation of citizens who think that the issue is in their immediate interest. Hence, elected officials often question the extent to which participants‚Äô priorities are a good proxy to represent ‚Äúthe public‚Äù.Participatory Value Evaluation ({PVE}) potentially circumvents this by allowing a large and diverse group of citizens to advise their government in an accessible manner. In an online environment, citizens step into the shoes of a policy maker and see which policy options the government considers, while being informed about the impacts. Next, they are asked to provide advice. Because {PVE} was originally designed as an economic evaluation method, it is unclear whether it can be deployed for effective participation.This study investigates how {PVE} could be deployed for effective participation of citizens in the energy transition through a real-world experiment in the Netherlands. We aimed to conduct the {PVE} in line with goals of stakeholders which is the most important requirement for effective participation. We fully achieved three goals that were defined by stakeholders: {PVE} enables participation of people that normally do not participate (particularly young people); low time investment of civil servants; outcomes of a {PVE} should be useful for decision-making. We partly achieved two goals: {PVE} raises awareness among citizens about decisions and implications of the energy transition; participation should be meaningful for citizens.},

The aims and objectives of this study are threefold: to interrogate which sociotechnical concepts or tools from {STS} are useful at better understanding energy-related social science, to reflect on prominent themes and topics within those approaches, and to identify current research gaps and directions for the future. To do so, the study builds on a companion project, a systematic analysis of 262 articles published from 2009 to mid-2019 that categorized and reviewed sociotechnical perspectives in energy social science. It identifies future research directions by employing the method of ‚Äúco-creation‚Äù based on the reflections of sixteen prominent researchers in the field in late 2019 and early 2020. Drawing from this co-created synthesis, this study first identifies three main areas of sociotechnical perspectives in energy research (sociotechnical systems, policy, and expertise and publics) with 15 topics and 39 subareas. The study then identifies five main themes for the future development of sociotechnical perspectives in energy research: conditions of systematic change; embedded agency; justice, power, identity and politics; imaginaries and discourses; and public engagement and governance. It also points to the recognized need for pluralism and parallax: for research to show greater attention to demographic and geographical diversity; to stronger research designs; to greater theoretical triangulation; and to more transdisciplinary approaches.},

Embodied energy injustices reframe considerations of energy justice to explicitly consider hidden and distant injustices (upstream or downstream) arising from the extraction, processing, transportation and disposal of energy resources. We assess the embodied energy injustices connected to the decision to decommission a coal-fired power plant in Salem, Massachusetts, {US}, and its replacement with a natural-gas-fired power station. Cerrej√≥n open-pit coalmine in La Guajira, Colombia, powered the Salem plant for over a decade. Fracked gas from Pennsylvania now supplies fuel for the new power station. Comparing the extraction of these two very different fuels reveals multiple parallel injustices. But the regulatory environment fails to account for the different constituencies, jurisdictions and effects that fall outside the formal remit of existing impact assessments. We therefore call for mandatory transboundary impact assessments of large-scale energy-related projects, which explicitly integrate previously unrecognized social-environmental harms and injustices. Expanding energy law and policy discussions to incorporate embodied energy injustices can enhance sustainable energy governance and enable corporate accountability for the transboundary harms of fossil fuel extraction and use. Linking chains of energy injustice‚Äîby revealing their interconnected positions along fossil-fuel supply chains‚Äîmay help generate and unite powerful trans-local solidarity movements, which politicize local struggles within wider national, regional and global energy politics.},

Results show that acceptance of the same project design differed significantly across alternative development locations.

Support for using wind energy for local electricity supply was the most important predictor of acceptance, and this variable mediated the relationship between island energy security and community acceptance.

We found original licenses had shorter average timelines than relicenses and project capacity was only related to timeline length when license type (i.e., original, relicense) was included in analyses. Both licensing timeline length and variability were impacted by the licensing process (Alternative, Integrated, Traditional) used. Projects with greater environmental complexity (e.g., endangered species) had significantly longer timelines than projects that were less environmentally complex. We attributed shorter timelines for original licenses to lower environmental complexity (e.g., no endangered species) because most original licenses involved development of already impacted sites. Projects with greater environmental complexity significantly impact resources that may require greater stakeholder involvement and increased study that can lead to longer licensing timelines.},

Here, we use multiple regression analyses on global datasets of national carbon emissions and renewable and nuclear electricity production across 123 countries over 25 years to examine systematically patterns in how countries variously using nuclear power and renewables contrastingly show higher or lower carbon emissions. We find that larger-scale national nuclear attachments do not tend to associate with significantly lower carbon emissions while renewables do. We also find a negative association between the scales of national nuclear and renewables attachments. This suggests nuclear and renewables attachments tend to crowd each other out.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the {CO}2 emissions caused by nuclear and renewable power generation. The knowledge of the share of coal, gas and oil in electricity generation permits the exact calculation of the related {CO}2 emissions. In addition, there is a second approach especially within the economic sciences, which applies statistical techniques for the study of the energy-related emissions. The background for these studies is the provision of general political advice and the expectation that political, cultural, or infrastructural considerations guide nations in the preference and choice of specific technologies. In this paper, we are applying both approaches and come to the certain conclusion, that nuclear power is as effective as renewable power in order to reduce the {CO}2 emissions. Our results are in complete contradiction to a recent publication (Sovacool et al. in Nat Energy 5:928‚Äì935, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-020-00696-3). The authors of this paper conclude that nuclear power does not reduce the {CO}2 emissions, but renewable power efficiently does. In addition, they argue that these two technologies crowd out each other. The possible reason for their claims may result from a specific conditioning of the data. In contrast, our analysis clearly confirms the adequacy of both nuclear and renewable power generation.},

The study included a longitudinal survey of residents prior to and after turbine installation, and semi-structured interviews with residents and key stakeholders. We assessed the extent to which respondents were engaged in the planning process, opinions of transparency and fairness, and degree to which the planning process affected their opinion. Although interviewees who held a negative view of state government indicated that it did not cause them to oppose the project, trust in state government was the primary driver of perceptions of process fairness, which in turn was the primary driver of project support. We also found individuals to withhold final judgment of the process until the final outcome‚Äîproject operation. Finally, fair process was seen as having benefits distinct from its effect on the outcome‚Äîthat is, local residents valued the process itself.},

	abstract = {The renewable energy projects involve multiple stakeholders; the social acceptance of these projects may convert into a thoughtful risk for the exploitation of renewable energy. Comprehending the process under which a social license to operate may be granted to a renewable energy project is significant. The ‚Äú{GO}‚Äù or ‚Äú{NO}-{GO}‚Äù decision for a renewable energy project is a vital task. In order to illustrate how renewable energy projects can be assessed from the sustainability point of view, two hypothetical scenarios were constructed. These scenarios describe a conceptual renewable energy project evaluated by five imaginary stakeholders under specific criteria and sustainability pillars. The first scenario is a ‚Äú{NO}-{GO}‚Äù scenario: the project is not sustainable due to significant environmental, social, economic, technological and geopolitical negative impacts. In this case, the social license to operate will not be endorsed by the stakeholders; important changes are needed before reassessment. The second scenario is a ‚Äú{GO}‚Äù scenario: the preferences of the stakeholders are such that the project may be considered sustainable and the social license to operate may be endorsed by the stakeholders. The methodology utilized to assess the two hypothetical scenarios for the same renewable energy project is the multi-criteria decision analysis combined with the multi-attribute utility theory. The quantification of assessment results was conducted with the assistance of a state-of-the-art decision support system (‚ÄúAcropolis {DSS}‚Äù), which allows decision-makers to evaluate multiple options that offer alternate solutions in ‚Äú{GO}-{NO}-{GO}‚Äù situations.},

Our most important focus is the characteristics of our major energy sources including each fuel's energy return on investment ({EROI}). The {EROI} of our most important fuels is declining and most renewable and non-conventional energy alternatives have substantially lower {EROI} values than traditional conventional fossil fuels. At the societal level, declining {EROI} means that an increasing proportion of energy output and economic activity must be diverted to attaining the energy needed to run an economy, leaving less discretionary funds available for ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù purchases which often drive growth. The declining {EROI} of traditional fossil fuel energy sources and the effect of that on the world economy are likely to result in a myriad of consequences, most of which will not be perceived as good.},

Energy Return on Investment ({EROI}) is a popular metric to assess the profitability of energy extraction processes, with {EROI} {\textgreater} 1 indicating that more energy is delivered to society than is used in the extraction process. Over the past decade, {EROI} analysis in particular has grown in popularity, resulting in an increase in publications in recent years. The lack of methodological consistency, however, among these papers has led to a situation where inappropriate comparisons are being made across technologies. In this paper we provide both a literature review and harmonization of {EROI} values to provide accurate comparisons of {EROIs} across both thermal fuels and electricity producing technologies. Most importantly, the authors advocate for the use of point-of-use {EROIs} rather than point-of-extraction {EROIs} as the energy ‚Äúcost‚Äù of the processes to get most thermal fuels from extraction to point of use drastically lowers their {EROI}. The main results indicate that {PV}, wind and hydropower have {EROIs} at or above ten while the {EROIs} for thermal fuels vary significantly, with that for petroleum oil notably below ten.},

A typical response of regulatory agencies has been to lay down minimum requirements for how hazardous facilities should be built and operated, without specifying the level of safety that it is hoping to achieve. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, charged with regulating safety in nuclear power plants, has recently tackled the safety question directly, by adopting "safety goals" that facilities must meet. The {NRC}'s approach proves to be sophisticated in some respects, incomplete in others. More generally, it points up the inherent difficulties that exist with the concept of "acceptable risk" and with any attempt to build policy instruments around it. Lessons from the {NRC} case apply to other hazardous technologies, as well as to public policies unrelated to safety.},

A classification of {ITM} goals is developed based on two types of sociotechnical transition goals (developing alternative technologies and ending existing technologies) and two types of societal change goals (the democratization of industrial organizations and political processes and the equitable access to jobs and industrial products). The study of processes and outcomes of {ITMs} also has implications for social movement theory, which are outlined.

	abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent "High Throughput" methods achieve surprising success--they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

So far, most studies have used the Das and Dennis‚Äôs structured approach for generating well-spaced reference points. Due to the highly structured nature of the procedure, this method cannot produce an arbitrary number of points, which is desired in an {EMaO} application. Although a layer-wise implementation has been suggested, {EMO} researchers always felt the need for a more generic approach. Motivated by earlier studies, we introduce a metric for deÔ¨Åning well-spaced points on a unit simplex and propose a number of viable methods for generating such a set. We compare the proposed methods on a variety of performance metrics such as hypervolume, deviation in triangularized simplices, distance of the closest point pair, and variance of the geometric means to nearest neighbors in up to 15-dimensional spaces. We show that an iterative improvement based on Riesz s-Energy is able to effectively Ô¨Ånd an arbitrary number of wellspaced points even in higher-dimensional spaces. Reference points created using the proposed Riesz s-Energy method for a number of standard combinations of objectives and reference points as well as a source code written in Python are available publicly at https://www.egr.msu.edu/coinlab/blankjul/uniform.},

Thereafter, we suggest a reference-point-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm following {NSGA}-{II} framework (we call it {NSGA}-{III}) that emphasizes population members that are nondominated, yet close to a set of supplied reference points. The proposed {NSGA}-{III} is applied to a number of many-objective test problems with three to 15 objectives and compared with two versions of a recently suggested {EMO} algorithm ({MOEA}/D). While each of the two {MOEA}/D methods works well on different classes of problems, the proposed {NSGA}-{III} is found to produce satisfactory results on all problems considered in this paper.

	abstract = {Addressing climate change requires societies to transition away from fossil fuels toward low-carbon energy, including renewables. Unfortunately, large wind projects have proven politically controversial, with groups opposing them across advanced economies. To date, there are few large-scale, systematic studies to identify the prevalence and predictors of opposition to wind energy projects. Here, we analyzed a dataset of wind energy projects across the United States and Canada between 2000 and 2016. We found that during this period, in the United States, 17\% of wind projects faced significant opposition, and in Canada, 18\% faced opposition, with rates in both countries growing over time. Opposition was concentrated regionally in the Northeastern United States and in Ontario, Canada. In both countries, larger projects with more turbines were more likely to be opposed. In the United States, opposition was more likely and more intense in areas with a higher proportion of White people, and a smaller proportion of Hispanic people. In Canada, opposition was more likely and more intense in wealthier communities. The most common tactics used to oppose wind energy were court cases, legislation, and physical protests. The number of people engaging in opposition to wind projects is likely small: Across articles that cited the number of individuals engaging in protests, the median number was 23 in the United States and 34 in Canada. When wealthier, Whiter communities oppose wind projects, this slows down the transition away from fossil fuel projects in poorer communities and communities of color, an environmental injustice we call ‚Äúenergy privilege.‚Äù},

Grounded in an expert guided literature review of 198 studies and their corresponding 332 case studies, it assesses the linkages between low carbon transitions‚Äîincluding renewable electricity, biofuel, nuclear power, smart grids, electric vehicles, and land use management‚Äîwith degradation, dispossession and destruction. It draws on a framework that envisions the political ecology of low-carbon transitions as consisting of four distinct processes: enclosure (capture of land or resources), exclusion (unfair planning), encroachment (destruction of the environment), or entrenchment (worsening of inequality or vulnerability). The study vigorously interrogates how these elements play out by country and across countries, by type of mitigation option, by type of victim or affected group, by process, and by severity, e.g. from modern slavery to organized crime, from violence, murder and torture to the exacerbation of child prostitution or the destruction of pristine ecosystems. It also closely examines the locations, disciplinary affiliations, methods and spatial units of analysis employed by this corpus of research, with clear and compelling insights for future work in the space of geography, climate change, and energy transitions. It suggest five critical avenues for future research: greater inclusivity and diversity, rigor and comparative analysis, focus on mundane technologies and non-Western case studies, multi-scalar analysis, and focus on policy and recommendations. At times, low-carbon transitions and climate action can promote squalor over sustainability and leave angry communities, disgruntled workers, scorned business partners, and degraded landscapes in their wake. Nevertheless, ample opportunities exist to make a future low-carbon world more pluralistic, democratic, and just.},

Our findings suggest that ramping up energy transition metals ({ETM}) could be more disruptive to demographic systems than ramping down coal. The data shows asymmetry in the distribution of risks: mine-town systems within the United States are most sensitive to coal phase-out, while systems in Australia and Canada are most sensitive to {ETM} phase-in.

In this study, we rely on a mixed methods research design involving household solar interviews (N¬†=¬†24), site visits (N¬†=¬†4 solar neighbourhoods), and a literature review to investigate four types of inequities associated with household solar adoption. We utilize a novel framework looking at demographic inequities (between groups), spatial inequities (across geographic scales), interspecies inequities (between humans and non-humans), and temporal inequities (across present and future generations). This framework enables not only the identification of multiple and often interlinked inequities; it also points the way towards how to make solar energy adoption more sustainable and just, with direct implications for solar business practices (and supply chains) as well as energy and climate policy.},

The broad themes of our framework are (i) politics, space and institutions, with sub-themes of justice, democracy, financialization; (ii) new processes and procedures, with sub-themes of legal recognition of public concerns, community-based planning, community capacity enhancement and life cycle impact assessment; and (iii) correlates of acceptance and resistance, with sub-themes of environmental values, perceived loss of amenity, pre-existing politics, perceptions of just process and trust in the developer.

Embodied energy injustices reframe considerations of energy justice to explicitly consider hidden and distant injustices (upstream or downstream) arising from the extraction, processing, transportation and disposal of energy resources. We assess the embodied energy injustices connected to the decision to decommission a coal-fired power plant in Salem, Massachusetts, {US}, and its replacement with a natural-gas-fired power station. Cerrej√≥n open-pit coalmine in La Guajira, Colombia, powered the Salem plant for over a decade. Fracked gas from Pennsylvania now supplies fuel for the new power station. Comparing the extraction of these two very different fuels reveals multiple parallel injustices. But the regulatory environment fails to account for the different constituencies, jurisdictions and effects that fall outside the formal remit of existing impact assessments. We therefore call for mandatory transboundary impact assessments of large-scale energy-related projects, which explicitly integrate previously unrecognized social-environmental harms and injustices. Expanding energy law and policy discussions to incorporate embodied energy injustices can enhance sustainable energy governance and enable corporate accountability for the transboundary harms of fossil fuel extraction and use. Linking chains of energy injustice‚Äîby revealing their interconnected positions along fossil-fuel supply chains‚Äîmay help generate and unite powerful trans-local solidarity movements, which politicize local struggles within wider national, regional and global energy politics.},

	abstract = {Low-carbon transitions are often assumed as positive phenomena, because they supposedly reduce carbon emissions, yet without vigilance, there is evidence that they can in fact create new injustices and vulnerabilities, while also failing to address pre-existing structural drivers of injustice in energy markets and the wider socio-economy. With this in mind, we examine four European low-carbon transitions from an unusual normative perspective: that of energy justice. Because a multitude of studies looks at the co-benefits of renewable energy, low-carbon mobility, or climate change mitigation, we instead ask in this paper what are the types of injustices associated with low-carbon transitions? Relatedly, in what ways do low-carbon transitions worsen social risks or vulnerabilities? Lastly, what policies might be deployed to make these transitions more just? We answer these questions by first elaborating an ‚Äúenergy justice‚Äù framework consisting of four distinct dimensions ‚Äî distributive justice (costs and benefits), procedural justice (due process), cosmopolitan justice (global externalities), and recognition justice (vulnerable groups). We then examine four European low-carbon transitions ‚Äî nuclear power in France, smart meters in Great Britain, electric vehicles in Norway, and solar energy in Germany ‚Äî through this critical justice lens. In doing so, we draw from original data collected from 64 semi-structured interviews with expert participants as well as five public focus groups and the monitoring of twelve large internet forums. We document 120 distinct energy injustices across these four transitions, including 19 commonly recurring injustices. We aim to show how when low-carbon transitions unfold, deeper injustices related to equity, distribution, and fairness invariably arise.},

Based on extensive, original mixed methods empirical research ‚Äì including expert interviews, focus groups, internet forums, community interviews, and extended site visits and naturalistic observation ‚Äì it asks: How are four specific decarbonisation pathways linked to negative impacts within specific communities? Relatedly, what vulnerabilities do these transitions exacerbate in these communities? Lastly, how can such vulnerabilities be better addressed with policy? The paper documents a troublesome cohabitation between French wineries and nuclear power, the negative effects on labor groups and workers in Eastern Germany by a transition to solar energy, the stark embodied externalities in electronic waste (e-waste) flows from smart meters accumulating in Ghana, and the precarious exploitation of children involved in cobalt mining for electric vehicle batteries in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The aims and objectives of the study are threefold: (1) to showcase how four very different vulnerable communities have been affected by the negative impacts of decarbonisation; (2) to reveal tensions and tradeoffs between European transitions and local and global justice concerns; and (3) to inform energy and climate policy. In identifying these objectives, our goal is not to stop or slow down all low-carbon transitions. Rather, the study suggests that the research and policy communities ought to account for, and seek to minimize, a broader range of social and environmental sustainability risks. Sustainability transitions and decarbonisation pathways must become more egalitarian, fair, and just.},

	abstract = {The need for multi-scalar analysis of energy and low-carbon systems is becoming more apparent as a way to assess the holistic socioeconomic and environmental impacts of energy transitions across a variety of scales and lifecycle stages. This paper conducts a whole systems energy justice analysis of four European low-carbon transitions‚Äînuclear power in France, smart meters in Great Britain, electric vehicles in Norway, and solar photovoltaic panels in Germany. It asks: in what ways may each of these transitions result in injustices that extend beyond communities and countries, i.e., across the whole system? It utilizes a mixed-methods research design based on 64 semi-structured research interviews with experts across all four transitions, five public focus groups, and the collection of 58 comments from twelve public internet forums to answer this question. Drawing inductively from these data, the paper identifies and analyzes 44 injustices spread across three spatial scales. Micro scale injustices concern immediate local impacts on family livelihood, community health and the environment. Meso scale injustices include national-scale issues such as rising prices for electricity and gas or unequal access to low-carbon technology. Macro scale injustices include global issues such as the extraction of minerals and metals and the circulation of waste flows. The paper then discusses these collective injustices in terms of their spatiality and temporality, before offering conclusions for energy and climate research and policy.},

It defines ‚Äúenergy justice‚Äù as a global energy system that fairly distributes both the benefits and burdens of energy services, and one that contributes to more representative and inclusive energy decision-making. The primary contribution of the article is its focus on six new frontiers of future energy justice research. First is making the case for the involvement of non-Western justice theorists. Second is expanding beyond humans to look at the Rights of Nature or non-anthropocentric notions of justice. Third is focusing on cross-scalar issues of justice such as embodied emissions. Fourth is identifying business models and the co-benefits of justice. Fifth is better understanding the tradeoffs within energy justice principles. Sixth is exposing unjust discourses. In doing so, the article presents an agenda constituted by 30 research questions as well as an amended conceptual framework consisting of ten principles. The article argues in favor of ‚Äújustice-aware‚Äù energy planning and policymaking, and it hopes that its (reconsidered) energy justice conceptual framework offers a critical tool to inform decision-making.},

	abstract = {Growth in renewable energy does not displace fossil fuel use on a one-to-one basis, but rather increases the total amount of energy that is produced. As numerous scholars have argued, an energy transition away from ‚Äì rather than in addition to ‚Äì fossil fuels will require more than technology and financial capital. Here we argue that a feminist perspective on energy provides an important framework for understanding what keeps us stuck in unsustainable energy cultures, as well as a paradigm for designing truly just energy systems. Feminist approaches have been widely taken up in environmental and ecofeminist work, as well as in climate change research. In energy studies, however, gender-related research has tended to focus more narrowly on women's issues. Although this is crucial work, the focus on women represents just one dimension of what feminism can bring to the study of energy. Feminist theory also offers expertise in the study of power more broadly, which is widely applicable to the full spectrum of energy research. This article outlines a feminist energy research agenda that addresses many aspects of energy system design, planning, exchange, and use. We analyze energy along four intersecting coordinates: the political (democratic, decentralized and pluralist); economic (prioritizing human well-being and biodiversity over profit and unlimited growth); socio-ecological (preferring relationality over individualism); and technological (privileging distributed and decentralized fuel power and people power). In doing so, we show that feminism is well-suited for navigating the tangled web of power, profit, and technological innovation that comprises human fuel use.},

Since the first nuclear detonation (Trinity test) and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, all in 1945, nuclear technology has profoundly affected world history and geopolitics, as well as our daily life and natural world. It has always been an instrument for national security, a marker of national sovereignty, a site of technological innovation and a promise of energy abundance. It has also introduced permanent pollution and the age of the Anthropocene. This volume presents a new perspective on nuclear history and politics by focusing on four interconnected themes‚Äìviolence and survival; control and containment; normalizing through denial and presumptions; memories and futures‚Äìand exploring their relationships and consequences. It proposes an original reflection on nuclear technology from a long-term, comparative and transnational perspective. It brings together contributions from researchers from different disciplines (anthropology, history, {STS}) and countries ({US}, France, Japan) on a variety of local, national and transnational subjects. Finally, this book offers an important and valuable insight into other global and Anthropocene challenges such as climate change.},

The promise of civilian atomic energy was a formidable tool of state power in the late twentieth century because it took advantage of social aspirations, anxieties, and environmental vulnerabilities, especially in the developing world. The deployment of rhetoric to promote atomic energy was inseparable from geopolitics writ large and has rarely been entirely peaceful.

These materials extend the impact of decisions made today into a far distant future, raising difficult questions regarding intergenerational and intragenerational social justice, ethical responsibility, and collective decision-making. This essay critically reviews those challenges using resources from the fields of communication and rhetoric, sociologies and philosophies of temporality and risk, and science and technology studies. The essay argues that modern notions of prediction, control, and decision-making are inadequate for addressing such highly complex phenomena and long temporal durations. Nuclear waste disposal is then examined as an activity that seeks not only to contain material hazards, but also to symbolically purify the system of nuclear production and consumption. The proposed U.S. nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain provides an example in which predictive models, which warrant both epistemic and political authority, are nevertheless insufficient bases for collective decision-making. The essay then considers the situation in the United States, where a new political economy of nuclear waste appears to be emerging, and offers summary conclusions regarding nuclear power and social justice.},

The reactor design in question is the {RBMK}, and this paper will argue that this design was far from ‚Äúcheap,‚Äù neither then nor now, and that its adoption as the second standard design for the Soviet Union‚Äôs nuclear power reactor fleet was based on much more than economic considerations. With the benefit of hindsight, it is easy to forget that reactor designs are always chosen for a multitude of reasons and never solely based on their technical or economic merits. Based on archival research, interviews, and industry publications, I show that approving and building {RBMK} reactors made good sense at the time, despite later claims to the contrary. Then I take the examples of a small modular reactor ({SMR}), the proposed {NuScale} Power Module, and a fast neutron reactor, {TerraPower}‚Äôs proposed Traveling Wave Reactor, to argue that we witness comparable negotiations today, as new designs for reactors (1) attempt to fit into existing safety and regulatory frameworks, (2) navigate security and nonproliferation concerns, and (3) embody visions of a specific sociotechnical order. I conclude that technical designs never occur in a socioeconomic, political, or cultural vacuum; instead, they are developed by people steeped in social norms, regulatory concerns, and economic expectations of a specific time and place. In the spirit of making this point relevant to practitioners, I will suggest ways of making these implicit frameworks visible, to actively and consciously start tweaking them, while staying aware of the implications that technical choices may have on our social expectations and vice versa.},

	abstract = {Historically, energy and climate research have failed to fully integrate research from the social sciences. This is problematic as the development of energy systems and the rapid acceleration of climate change are directly tied to human activity. When the social sciences are incorporated in energy and climate research, their scope is frequently economically oriented. Methodological approaches remain frequently quantitative in nature. While important, these approaches cannot fully capture the nuances of power, inequality, and justice within decisionmaking processes that create and constitute our energy systems and subsequent climate change impacts and outcomes. As energy decisions and policies continue to increasingly shape the extent to which the world is impacted by climate change, we must think precisely about the complexity of identity and who is involved in energy decisions; who benefits from, and who is burdened by particular sets of energy decisions and the impacts of climate change. In addition, we must examine how these burdens and benefits manifest differently based on individual and group identities. To ignore these questions creates a research field where social actors and organizations remain decoupled from their role and responsibilities in the construction of and participation in these energy systems; where the embeddedness of a system is taken for granted, remains unscrutinized and unchallenged, and acts as a path-dependent barrier to the envisioning and building of an alternative energy future. In order to strengthen energy and climate change research and policy we must engage in research methods that can better account for underlying issues of power and justice within the decisionmaking processes across multiple socio-political scales. More specifically in this paper, I argue that using qualitative methodological tools rooted in intersectional feminist theory, such as a multi-sited critical policy ehtnography, are a crucial way to do so.},

Complexity is understood in its relation to processes of simplification, that occur in the research field, but are also produced by the scientists. The decision in favour of a specific method is understood as a political decision, which influences our capacity not only to examine dominant perspectives and processes, but also to explore invisible and silenced elements, actors and positions in energy cultures. The critical question under investigation is how transformation processes of the way we produce, use and distribute energy can be initiated that entail political as well as scientific practices and processes in which diversity, complexity and modes of reflection are inscribed? Based on the example of energy research governance in the European Union, the article explores how situational analysis with its distinct mapping tools supports the researcher to debate and reflect on simplifications, complexity and power relations, while simultaneously critically asses the problems and challenges of the method.},

In this study we address research gaps in historical and current ambient air emissions burdens in environmental justice communities from power plants participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gases Initiative ({RGGI}), the country‚Äôs first market-based power sector emissions reduction program. We find that in {RGGI} states the percentage of people of color that live within 0‚Äì6.2 miles from power plants is up to 23.5 percent higher than the percent of the white population that lives within those same distance bands, and the percentage of people living in poverty that live within 0‚Äì5 miles from power plants is up to 15.3 percent higher than the percent of the population not living in poverty within those same distance bands. More importantly, the transition from coal to natural gas underway before {RGGI} formally started resulted in large increases in both the number of electric-generating units burning natural gas and total net generation from natural gas in environmental justice communities hosting electric-generating units, compared to other communities. Our findings indicate that power sector carbon mitigation policies‚Äô focusing on aggregate emissions reductions have largely benefitted non-environmental justice communities and have not redressed the fundamental problem of disparities in pollutant burdens between {EJ} and non-{EJ} communities. These must be directly addressed in climate change and carbon emissions mitigation policy.},

This method is based on an integration of the existing interval linear programming ({ILP}), two-stage programming ({TSP}) and superiority‚Äìinferiority-based fuzzy-stochastic programming ({SI}-{FSP}). It allows uncertainties presented as both probability/possibilistic distributions and interval values to be incorporated within a general optimization framework, facilitating the reflection of multiple uncertainties and complexities during the process of renewable energy management systems planning. {ISITSP}-{CREM} can also be used for effectively addressing dynamic interrelationships between renewable energy availabilities, economic penalties and electricity-generation deficiencies within a community scale. Thus, complexities in renewable energy management systems can be systematically reflected, highly enhancing applicability of the modeling process. The developed method has then been applied to a case of long-term renewable energy management planning for three communities. Useful solutions for the planning of renewable energy management systems have been generated. Interval solutions associated with different energy availabilities and economic penalties have been obtained. They can be used for generating decision alternatives and thus help decision makers identify desired policies under various economic and system-reliability constraints. The generated solutions can also provide desired energy resource/service allocation plans with a minimized system cost (or economic penalties), a maximized system reliability level and a maximized energy security. Tradeoffs between system costs and energy security can also be tackled. Higher costs will increase potential energy generation amount, while a desire for lower system costs will run into a risk of energy deficiency. They are helpful for supporting: (a) adjustment or justification of allocation patterns of renewable energy resources and services, (b) formulation of local policies regarding energy utilization, economic development and energy structure under various energy availabilities and policy interventions, and (c) analysis of interactions among economic cost, system reliability and energy-supply shortage.},

	abstract = {The design of efficient energy systems, through the development of new technologies and the improvement of current ones, requires the use of rigorous process synthesis methods for generating and analysing design alternatives. We introduce a digital twin of process and energy system design that interactively translates needs and preferences of decision makers into an optimization-based model and generates meaningful solutions. The Interactive Digital Twin ({InDiT}) assists decision makers in steering the exploration of the solution space and guiding them towards relevant system design decisions, taking into account multiple aspects such as the impact of uncertainties and multi-criteria analysis. {InDiT} enhances step-by-step communication with the decision maker, relying on visual aids to keep the communication during solution generation and exploration intuitive and flexible. In this way, decision makers are guided towards relevant solutions and improve their understanding of relations between the problem definition and system design decisions, while {InDiT} builds on the decision makers‚Äô preferences and can, after training, suggest solutions that are best-suited to their interests. The novelty of this work lies in the holistic approach of addressing both (i) the systematic generation and exploration of solutions with the assistance of a digital consultant, which translates the decision maker‚Äôs needs into machine language and vice versa, and (ii) the interactive step-by-step technique on filtering and evaluating solutions intuitively. This guarantees that the decision maker does not only get solutions based on the design specifications made, but that personal preferences are taken into account during the solution synthesis step, and that the solution space can easily be explored under different criteria. The proposed methodology is demonstrated and applied to the design case of an integrated multi-product biorefinery.},

We find a lack of consistency between the visions of nuclear power put forward by governments and industry and the experience associated with economic viability, nuclear accidents, waste handling, and so on. We use the conceptual tool of holon from complexity theory to provide a link between the models used for the governance of nuclear power and the realization of those models. The analysis of the holon over time reveals a systemic inconsistency between the way in which the story about nuclear energy is told and the experience gained after implementing nuclear energy according to the story. This inconsistency is due to the incompatible levels of observation used by different social actors endorsing different perspectives. The implementation of nuclear power has been based on the engineering view, focusing on the functioning of the nuclear power plant considered in abstraction from the wider implications of the adoption of this technology on the environment, on the economy, and on society. We cross-check this narrative with the societal metabolism view in order to provide a long term perspective of the interdependencies between nuclear power and the complex socio-economic system in which it is embedded. We conclude that the controversy over nuclear power may be treated as a problem of contrasting beliefs and normative values in clear disjunction from experience. The analysis presented in this paper suggests that more attention should be given to the quality of the narratives used in policy making.},

To ease the siting process, host compensation in exchange for permission to construct a landfill has become popular. The value and nature of host compensation varies dramatically across communities, but the reasons for this variation are relatively unexplored. We construct a national data set consisting of host fees paid by the 104 largest privately owned solid waste landfills in 1996, along with the characteristics of the landfills and the host communities. Our findings suggest that he direct participation of citizens in host fee negotiations, the community knowledge stemming from having hosted a prior landfill, and the presence of state mandates for minimum host compensation all lead to much greater amounts of host compensation. We find that the bargaining position of the landfill developer is less important, in terms of the magnitude of the effect. However we do find evidence that firms with deeper pockets are more likely to pay higher host fees. We find limited evidence that a community‚Äôs race and income level matter after accounting for factors that directly reflect citizen involvement. The analysis also indicates that landfills that accept risky wastes, such as contaminated soil or sludge, and problematic wastes, such as tires pay higher host fees.},

However, it compromises short-term public health and safety and security, due to the separation of plutonium. The trade-offs in nuclear energy are reducible to a chief trade-off between the present and the future. To what extent should we take care of our produced nuclear waste and to what extent should we accept additional risks to the present generation, in order to diminish the exposure of future generation to those risks? The advocates of the open fuel cycle should explain why they are willing to transfer all the risks for a very long period of time (200,000¬†years) to future generations. In addition, supporters of the closed fuel cycle should underpin their acceptance of additional risks to the present generation and make the actual reduction of risk to the future plausible.},

As a result, we ‚Äúwillingly sleepwalk through the process of reconstituting the conditions of human existence.‚Äù Winner suggests several reasons for this somnambulism, including beliefs about the neutrality of technology and technological determinism. He is critical of each of these. Winner is also critical of the near exclusive focus of technological assessment on the positive and negative impacts or effects of a technology. Technologies certainly have impacts, but they also can restructure our physical and social worlds, and so how we live. Winner argues that this understanding of technologies as ‚Äúforms of life‚Äù needs to inform our evaluations and choices regarding technological innovation and adoption.},

Most understandings of environmental justice refer to the issue of equity, or the distribution of environmental ills and benefits. But defining environmental justice as equity is incomplete, as activists, communities, and non-governmental organisations ({NGOs}) call for much more than just distribution. This essay examines how definitions beyond the distributive in these movements can help us develop conceptions of global environmental justice. The argument is that the justice demanded by global environmental justice is really threefold: equity in the distribution of environmental risk, recognition of the diversity of the participants and experiences in affected communities, and participation in the political processes which create and manage environmental policy. The existence of three different notions of justice in the movement, simultaneously, demonstrates the plausibility of a plural yet unified theory and practice of justice.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces many objective robust decision making ({MORDM}). {MORDM} combines concepts and methods from many objective evolutionary optimization and robust decision making ({RDM}), along with extensive use of interactive visual analytics, to facilitate the management of complex environmental systems. Many objective evolutionary search is used to generate alternatives for complex planning problems, enabling the discovery of the key tradeoffs among planning objectives. {RDM} then determines the robustness of planning alternatives to deeply uncertain future conditions and facilitates decision makers' selection of promising candidate solutions. {MORDM} tests each solution under the ensemble of future extreme states of the world ({SOW}). Interactive visual analytics are used to explore whether solutions of interest are robust to a wide range of plausible future conditions (i.e., assessment of their Pareto satisficing behavior in alternative {SOW}). Scenario discovery methods that use statistical data mining algorithms are then used to identify what assumptions and system conditions strongly influence the cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability of the robust alternatives. The framework is demonstrated using a case study that examines a single city's water supply in the Lower Rio Grande Valley ({LRGV}) in Texas, {USA}. Results suggest that including robustness as a decision criterion can dramatically change the formulation of complex environmental management problems as well as the negotiated selection of candidate alternatives to implement. {MORDM} also allows decision makers to characterize the most important vulnerabilities for their systems, which should be the focus of ex post monitoring and identification of triggers for adaptive management.},

Discussing the meaning and consequences for engineering design, I review the solution methods to such problems presented in the engineering design literature in the light of the theorem. It appears that underlying such methods is a mix-up of two fundamentally different problem definitions, as the theory of multi-attribute preferences, which is often presented as an adequate approach for engineering design, in fact fails to address the Arrowian multi-criteria problem. Finally, I suggest ways how engineering design might adopt results from discussions of Arrow‚Äôs theorem elsewhere in resolving its multi-criteria decision problems.},

	abstract = {End-of-life ({EOL}) solar panels may become a source of hazardous waste although there are enormous benefits globally from the growth in solar power generation. Global installed {PV} capacity reached around 400¬†{GW} at the end of 2017 and is expected to rise further to 4500¬†{GW} by 2050. Considering an average panel lifetime of 25 years, the worldwide solar {PV} waste is anticipated to reach between 4\%-14\% of total generation capacity by 2030 and rise to over 80\% (around 78 million tonnes) by 2050. Therefore, the disposal of {PV} panels will become a pertinent environmental issue in the next decades. Eventually, there will be great scopes to carefully investigate on the disposal and recycling of {PV} panels {EOL}. The {EU} has pioneered {PV} electronic waste regulations including {PV}-specific collection, recovery and recycling targets. The {EU} Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment ({WEEE}) Directive entails all producers supplying {PV} panels to the {EU} market to finance the costs of collecting and recycling {EOL} {PV} panels in Europe. Lessons can be learned from the involvement of the {EU} in forming its regulatory framework to assist other countries develop locally apposite approaches. This review focused on the current status of solar panel waste recycling, recycling technology, environmental protection, waste management, recycling policies and the economic aspects of recycling. It also provided recommendations for future improvements in technology and policy making. At present, {PV} recycling management in many countries envisages to extend the duties of the manufacturers of {PV} materials to encompass their eventual disposal or reuse. However, further improvements in the economic viability, practicality, high recovery rate and environmental performance of the {PV} industry with respect to recycling its products are indispensable.},

Though commonly viewed as a waste‚Äîwith over 300,000 tons stored worldwide and an additional 7‚Äì11,000 tons accumulating annually‚Äîspent nuclear fuel ({SNF}) represents a significant potential source of scarce, valuable strategic materials. Beyond the major (U and Pu) and minor (Np, Am, and Cm) actinides, which can be used to generate further energy, resources including the rare earth elements (Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, and Tb), platinum group metals, (Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ag), noble gases (He, Kr, and Xe), and a range of isotopes useful for medical and energy generation purposes are also produced during fission. One reason for the accumulation of so much {SNF} is the low uptake of {SNF} recycle (or reprocessing), primarily due to the high capital and operational costs alongside concerns regarding proliferation and wastes generated. This study will highlight the predominantly overlooked potential for the recovery of strategic materials from {SNF}, which may offset costs and facilitate advanced waste management techniques for minimised waste volumes, thus increasing the sustainability of the nuclear fuel cycle on the path towards Net Zero. Potential challenges in the implementation of this concept will also be identified.},

Nevertheless, nuclear energy's history, including meltdowns such as Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima, and dumping in sacred Indigenous land such as Yucca Mountain, raises important concerns in public deliberation over nuclear power. These communicative dynamics are crucial to study because they inform larger conversations in communication scholarship about the role of experts in scientific controversies and the complicated nature of public trust in and engagement with science. Thus, this study explores the perspectives of experts and how they make sense of their own communicative practices through a topical analysis of semi-structured interviews with 12 nuclear scientists and engineers in the United States and Canada. Our analysis revealed four major topoi: (1) risk and safety, (2) government and policy, and (3) public education and engagement, and (4) cost, along which nuclear experts make sense of science-public boundaries and their role as scientists and scientist citizens. This paper extends our understanding and how scientists view themselves as communicative actors and the barriers and opportunities for how we can foster productive technical-public relationships around climate change solutions.},

	abstract = {Science communication has been historically predicated on the knowledge deficit model. Yet, empirical research has shown that public communication of science is more complex than what the knowledge deficit model suggests. In this essay, we pose four lines of reasoning and present empirical data for why we believe the deficit model still persists in public communication of science. First, we posit that scientists‚Äô training results in the belief that public audiences can and do process information in a rational manner. Second, the persistence of this model may be a product of current institutional structures. Many graduate education programs in science, technology, engineering, and math ({STEM}) fields generally lack formal training in public communication. We offer empirical evidence that demonstrates that scientists who have less positive attitudes toward the social sciences are more likely to adhere to the knowledge deficit model of science communication. Third, we present empirical evidence of how scientists conceptualize ‚Äúthe public‚Äù and link this to attitudes toward the deficit model. We find that perceiving a knowledge deficit in the public is closely tied to scientists‚Äô perceptions of the individuals who comprise the public. Finally, we argue that the knowledge deficit model is perpetuated because it can easily influence public policy for science issues. We propose some ways to uproot the deficit model and move toward more effective science communication efforts, which include training scientists in communication methods grounded in social science research and using approaches that engage community members around scientific issues.},

	abstract = {The Texas freeze of February 2021 left more than 4.5 million customers (more than 10 million people) without electricity at its peak, some for several days. The freeze had cascading effects on other services reliant upon electricity including drinking water treatment and medical services. Economic losses from lost output and damage are estimated to be \$130 billion in Texas alone. In the wake of the freeze, there has been major fallout among regulators and utilities as actors sought to apportion blame and utilities and generators began to settle up accounts. This piece offers a retrospective on what caused the blackouts and the knock-on effects on other services, the subsequent financial and political effects of the freeze, and the implications for Texas and the country going forward. Texas failed to sufficiently winterize its electricity and gas systems after 2011. Feedback between failures in the two systems made the situation worse. Overall, the state faced outages of 30 {GW} of electricity as demand reached unprecedented highs. The gap between production and demand forced the non-profit grid manager, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ({ERCOT}), to cut off supply to millions of customers or face a systems collapse that by some accounts was minutes away. The 2021 freeze suggests a need to rethink the state‚Äôs regulatory approach to energy to avoid future such outcomes. Weatherization, demand response, and expanded interstate interconnections are potential solutions Texas should consider to avoid generation losses, reduce demand, and tap neighboring states‚Äô capacity.},

They co-opt the terminology of utopia to positions that are antagonistic to radical alterity. But this is not a necessary response to the utopia/pragmatism tension: Unger, who is explicitly opposed to utopia, in fact proffers a more sympathetic resolution based on the merits of vision, social improvization and collective learning.

	abstract = {Background
Transformative utopian impulse for planetary health is people's propensity to have thoughts and engage in actions of which the purpose is to transform the current society into a better one in the future by addressing existing global issues. We aimed to develop a well-validated scale that can measure the transformative utopian impulse for planetary health and uncover its role in societal transformation.
Methods
We developed a scale to measure the transformative utopian impulse for planetary health across 11 studies with 6248 participants from the {USA} (from the {MTurk} database) and the {UK} (from the Prolifico.co database). Participants were eligible take part in the studies if they completed the consent form. Participants who did not pass the seriousness check or did not accurately answer all instructed response items were excluded from statistical analyses. We used exploratory factor analyses ({EFA}) and confirmatory factor analyses ({CFA}) to determine the factor structure of the Transformative Utopian Impulse for Planetary Health Scale ({TUIPHS}). Then we analysed the {TUIPHS}‚Äô nomological network (ie, the relationships between {TUIPHS} and various constructs ranging from personality traits and values to economic, social, and political attitudes and beliefs). We then examined the scale's incremental predictive validity by testing whether it predicts various attitudes and behaviours relevant to social change beyond scales that measure competing constructs (this part of the study is registered at {OSF} Registries [https://osf.io/ztj2f]). Finally, we examined the {TUIPHS}‚Äô longitudinal predictive validity by probing whether it predicts people's future support for social change.
Findings
Data were collected between Oct 8, 2018, and July 6, 2020. We established that {TUIPHS} has a four-factor structure and can also be scored as a single general factor, indicating that it captures an overarching theoretical construct (ie, the transformative utopian impulse for planetary health). We then showed that the scale is related to various specific individual difference measures that capture diverse aspects of people's propensity to actively engage in thoughts and actions oriented toward the betterment of society. Moreover, {TUIPHS} predicted, above and beyond 20 competing scales highly correlated (r ‚â•0¬∑50) with it, a series of 19 self-reported behavioural and attitudinal constructs pertaining to social change. Finally, participants‚Äô past {TUIPHS} scores predicted their support, a few months later, for social movements that aim to build a more just and resilient society than in the current day.
Interpretation
This research lays the groundwork for future theoretical and empirical research into the psychological and behavioural processes attached to the transformative utopian impulse for planetary health as a source of transformative social change toward a better way of being and living.

Specifically, the paper contributes to understanding how particular ideologies of modernism and development present in territorial planning connect both countries. Taking Thomas More‚Äôs classic work ‚ÄòUtopia‚Äô as the analytical reference, I analyze how utopian tendencies have traveled through time and space to shape territorial planning and water governance. In both countries, this was evident in the late nineteenth century through the political project to strengthen the nation state. For Spain, I describe the regenerationist movement and the hydraulic utopia led by the Spanish intellectual Joaqu√≠n Costa, who forged the dream of a water nationhood. By contrast, in Colombia, several political intellectuals looked at Europe and North America as a source of inspiration to achieve progress by controlling rivers. Through the method of disjunctive comparison, I show how the same utopian notions are expressed in similar ways in distinct contexts: violently governing the flows of rivers, standardizing minds and ordering territories towards capital growth. This paper contributes to grasping the notions and roots of the discourses that have colonized the political water agendas in both countries.},

	abstract = {Engaging non-experts in matters of science and technology has been increasingly stressed in both rhetoric and action during the past decades. Under the call for moving participation upstream, agenda setting processes have been identified as viable entry point for laypeople‚Äôs experiential and value-based knowledge into science, technology and innovation governance ({STI}). Harnessing visioning for target setting promises to elicit such knowledge, whilst at the same time evading the dilemma of informing participants about {STI} that does not exist prior to engagement. To test such claims, we investigate a large-scale citizen-visioning exercise employed as an initiation of a transdisciplinary research and innovation agenda setting process, namely {CIMULACT}. In a comparable Europe-wide process, more than 1000 laypeople (citizens) produced 179 visions of desirable futures which built the basis for co-creating future research topics for advising the {EU} research and innovation programme Horizon 2020. We provide in depth insights into the visioning methodology for inclusion of citizens into {STI} agenda setting, and discuss room for methodological improvement regarding potential loss and gains of creativity and diversity of opinions considering empirical results of ex-post participant evaluation questionnaires (n ‚âà 964). The discussed data shows a generally positive evaluation of the process and engagement, since citizens are in retrospective content with the process and visions, they would participate again in a similar event, and they are in favour of the {EU} to continue hosting such events in the future. However, citizens were rather sceptic whether the results actually (can/will) have an impact on the stated aim of integration in research and innovation agenda setting.},

	abstract = {The autonomous vehicle ({AV}) is one of the first commercialized {AI}-embedded robots to make autonomous decisions. Despite technological advancements, unavoidable {AV} accidents that result in life-and-death consequences cannot be completely eliminated. The emerging social concern of how an {AV} should make ethical decisions during unavoidable accidents is referred to as the moral dilemma of {AV}, which has promoted heated discussions among various stakeholders. However, there are research gaps in explainable {AV} ethical decision-making processes that predict how {AVs}‚Äô moral behaviors are made that are acceptable from the {AV} users‚Äô perspectives. This study addresses the key question: What factors affect ethical behavioral intentions in the {AV} moral dilemma? To answer this question, this study draws theories from multidisciplinary research fields to propose the ‚ÄúIntegrative ethical decision-making framework for the {AV} moral dilemma.‚Äù The framework includes four interdependent ethical decision-making stages: {AV} moral dilemma issue framing, intuitive moral reasoning, rational moral reasoning, and ethical behavioral intention making. Further, the framework includes variables (e.g., perceived moral intensity, individual factors, and personal moral philosophies) that influence the ethical decision-making process. For instance, the framework explains that {AV} users from Eastern cultures will tend to endorse a situationist ethics position (high idealism and high relativism), which views that ethical decisions are relative to context, compared to {AV} users from Western cultures. This proposition is derived from the link between individual factors and personal moral philosophy. Moreover, the framework proposes a dual-process theory, which explains that both intuitive and rational moral reasoning are integral processes of ethical decision-making during the {AV} moral dilemma. Further, this framework describes that ethical behavioral intentions that lead to decisions in the {AV} moral dilemma are not fixed, but are based on how an individual perceives the seriousness of the situation, which is shaped by their personal moral philosophy. This framework provides a step-by-step explanation of how pluralistic ethical decision-making occurs, reducing the abstractness of {AV} moral reasoning processes.},

	abstract = {Utilitarian versus deontological inclinations have been studied extensively in the field of moral psychology. However, the field has been lacking a thorough psychometric evaluation of the most commonly used measures. In this paper, we examine the factorial structure of an often used set of 12 moral dilemmas purportedly measuring utilitarian/deontological moral inclinations. We ran three different studies (and a pilot) to investigate the issue. In Study 1, we used standard Exploratory Factor Analysis and Schmid-Leimann (g factor) analysis; results of which informed the a priori single-factor model for our second study. Results of Confirmatory Factor Analysis in Study 2 were replicated in Study 3. Finally, we ran a weak invariance analysis between the models of Study 2 and 3, concluding that there is no significant difference between factor loading in these studies. We find reason to support a single-factor model of utilitarian/deontological inclinations. In addition, certain dilemmas have consistent error covariance, suggesting that this should be taken into consideration in future studies. In conclusion, three studies, pilot and an invariance analysis, systematically suggest the following. (1) No item needs to be dropped from the scale. (2) There is a unidimensional structure for utilitarian/deontological preferences behind the most often used dilemmas in moral psychology, suggesting a single latent cognitive mechanism. (3) The most common set of dilemmas in moral psychology can be successfully used as a unidimensional measure of utilitarian/deontological moral inclinations, but would benefit from using weighted averages over simple averages. (4) Consideration should be given to dilemmas describing infants.},

Improved efficiency‚Äîthe hallmark of these systems‚Äîdrives their mass integration into day-to-day life.

In particular, a persistent and recurrent trend within the literature indicates that society's most vulnerable are disproportionally impacted. When algorithmic injustice and harm are brought to the fore, most of the solutions on offer (1) revolve around technical solutions and (2) do not center disproportionally impacted communities. This paper proposes a fundamental shift‚Äîfrom rational to relational‚Äîin thinking about personhood, data, justice, and everything in between, and places ethics as something that goes above and beyond technical solutions. Outlining the idea of ethics built on the foundations of relationality, this paper calls for a rethinking of justice and ethics as a set of broad, contingent, and fluid concepts and down-to-earth practices that are best viewed as a habit and not a mere methodology for data science. As such, this paper mainly offers critical examinations and reflection and not ‚Äúsolutions.‚Äù},

	volume = {8},
	abstract = {Background: Answering the question ‚Äúwhat is the right thing to do?‚Äù is, for most nurses and other healthcare professionals, an ethical question. Many decisions in healthcare are based on determining whether or not an action, or intervention, is to be taken. When a framework is used to help guide these decisions patient care can be improved. Relational ethics is an ethical framework that has been developed by an interdisciplinary team to help healthcare professionals answer ethical questions within complex environments. When applying this action ethic framework health professionals are guided to create the moral space where responsiveness and responsibility for yourself and the other is enacted and ethical questions answered. Aims: The purpose of this article is to discuss and describe the core elements of Relational Ethics and to demonstrate how a relational ethics framework can be used to facilitate ethical healthcare decision-making.
Method: A clinical exemplar, drawn from a mental health nursing setting, is used to demonstrate how a relational ethic framework can be applied within a clinical healthcare context.
Results: Through the use of a relational ethics framework the essential core elements of Relational Ethics are applied which resulted in ethically reflective healthcare decision-making.
Conclusions: Clinicians are able to directly apply an ethical framework to their healthcare practice. Additionally, Relational Ethics is a promising action ethic which can be used to create the moral space needed to enact ethical decision-making.},

Ubuntu  has been proposed as a useful alternative to current (Western) ethical frameworks for evaluating global bioethical issues, contributing theoretical diversity to the clinical context. However, the literature regarding this philosophy is often described as confusing, and is characterised by a number of competing interpretations.¬†   Objective.  To arrive, by way of a systematic review, at a definition of  ubuntu  that encompasses the common themes that appear in competing interpretations.¬†   Methods.  Searches were done in {PhilPaper}, {PubMed} and Google Scholar using a variety of search strings, generating 1 207 hits. After screening for English language, as well as relevance of the article after reading the title, abstract and full text, 99 articles were included for review. Another 17 articles were identified through snowballing and additional searches, giving a total of 116 articles that were included in the review.¬†   Results.  This review shows that  ubuntu  is an essentially relational ethics, which prizes relationships of interdependence, fellowship, reconciliation, relationality, community friendliness, harmonious relationships and other-regarding actions such as compassion and actions that are likely to be good for others, in which actions are morally right to the extent that they honour the capacity to relate communally, reduce discord or promote friendly relationships with others, and in which the physical world and the spiritual world are fundamentally united.¬†   Conclusion.  Scholars, health professionals, policy makers and others should be aware that an alternative ethical theory exists in the global South that may be applied to address a variety of global (bio)ethical issues. Further research, however, is needed to evaluate how properly action-guiding this formulation is in particular contexts.},

	abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence ({AI}) in healthcare has the potential to improve patient outcomes and increase efficiency in the delivery of care. However, the design, deployment and use of {AI} in healthcare must be guided by a set of ethical principles that prioritize the well-being of patients and the community, and ensure that care is delivered equitably. A growing body of literature on algorithmic injustice illustrates that {AI} systems in healthcare have the potential to cause social harm, especially to vulnerable communities. Existing ethical principles in healthcare are based on, and mostly influenced by, Western epistemology, which emphasizes individual rights, often at the expense of collective well-being. The African philosophy of Ubuntu, which emphasises the interconnectedness and interdependence of all people, is an attractive framework for addressing ethical concerns in {AI} for healthcare because healthcare is intrinsically a community-wide issue. This paper discusses the relevance of Ubuntu ethics in the context of {AI} for healthcare and proposes principles to reinvigorate the spirit of ‚ÄúI am because we are‚Äù in design, deployment and use. These principles are fairness, community good, safeguarding humanity, respect for others and trust, and we believe their application will support co-designing, deploying and using inclusive {AI} systems that will enable clinicians to deliver equitable care for all. Highlighting the relational aspect of Ubuntu, this paper not only calls for rethinking {AI} ethics in healthcare but also endorses discussions about the need for non-Western ethical approaches to be utilised in {AI} ethics more broadly.},

	abstract = {The term ‚Äúsocial contract‚Äù is increasingly used in social science literature to describe sets of state-society relations ‚Äì in particular with reference to the Middle East and North Africa ({MENA}). Nevertheless, the term has thus far remained insufficiently conceptualized and its potential to inform a systematic analysis of contemporary states has been underutilized. This article contributes to the filling of this gap. It defines social contracts as sets of formal and informal agreements between societal groups and their sovereign (government or other actor in power) on rights and obligations toward each other. We argue that social contracts are partly informal institutions, which are meant to make state-society interactions more predictable and thereby politics more stable. Their effectiveness depends on their substance (deliverables exchanged between government and society), scope (the actors involved and the geographic range of influence) and temporal dimension (beginning, evolution, and duration). Social contracts can differ substantially in all three dimensions. This approach complements established theories of comparative politics and sharpens the perspective on state-society relations. It helps to (i) compare state-society relations in different countries, (ii) track changes within one country, (iii) find out when and why social contracts are broken or even revoked, (iv) uncover how external players affect state-society relations, and (v) analyze how state-society relations can be Pareto improved. Against this background, this article shows that after independence, {MENA} countries had quite similar social contracts, which were based on the provision of social benefits rather than political participation. We argue that they degenerated steadily after 1985 due to increasing populations and budgetary problems. The Arab uprisings in 2010‚Äì11 were an expression of discontent with a situation in which governments provided neither political participation nor social benefits, like employment. Since then, social contracts in {MENA} countries have developed in different directions, and their long-term stability is questionable. We address the question of how they can be transformed to become more inclusive and therefore more stable.},

Empirical findings from this investigation are used to evaluate existing formalized engineering ethics in relation to engineering praxis. Juxtaposed with engineers‚Äô everyday ethical decision-making practices, professional ethics approaches are shown to be based in deontological and virtue ethics, narrowly focused on the individual engineer as a professional, and thus inappropriate and insufficient for the very practical field of engineering.

	abstract = {We examine the thermodynamic evolution of various evolving systems, from primitive physical systems to complex living systems, and conclude that they involve similar processes which are phenomenological manifestations of the second law of thermodynamics. We take the reformulated second law of thermodynamics of Hatsopoulos and Keenan and Kestin and extend it to nonequilibrium regions, where nonequilibrium is described in terms of gradients maintaining systems at some distance away from equilibrium. The reformulated second law suggests that as systems are moved away from equilibrium they will take advantage of all available means to resist externally applied gradients. When highly ordered complex systems emerge, they develop and grow at the expense of increasing the disorder at higher levels in the system's hierarchy. We note that this behaviour appears universally in physical and chemical systems. We present a paradigm which provides for a thermodynamically consistent explanation of why there is life, including the origin of life, biological growth, the development of ecosystems, and patterns of biological evolution observed in the fossil record. We illustrate the use of this paradigm through a discussion of ecosystem development. We argue that as ecosystems grow and develop, they should increase their total dissipation, develop more complex structures with more energy flow, increase their cycling activity, develop greater diversity and generate more hierarchical levels, all to abet energy degradation. Species which survive in ecosystems are those that funnel energy into their own production and reproduction and contribute to autocatalytic processes which increase the total dissipation of the ecosystem. In short, ecosystems develop in ways which systematically increase their ability to degrade the incoming solar energy. We believe that our thermodynamic paradigm makes it possible for the study of ecosystems to be developed from a descriptive science to predictive science founded on the most basic principle of physics.},

When policy documents make particular assumptions about care work requiring private, not public, consideration, this can push care, its concerns, and those who give and receive care out of the public sphere. This marginalization of care work, however, is ethically suspect, and as such I argue here that we should use the feminist ethics of care as a way to analyze current policy and guide the creation of future policy to ensure more ethically robust policy statements. I advocate for the use of care ethics in addition to human rights ethically guided public policy, which prioritizes the effort to implement human rights standards through government action. My claim is that human rights should not be our sole basis for moral and political reasoning, especially in the policy process. Policy shapes our lives, and how we live in relation to particular others. Care ethics can and should be used as an ethical guide for the policy process because it can bring to the fore how institutional patterns of power shape our relations, an analysis that human rights theories are not, in general, built to undertake.},

We attempt to use ubuntu to countermand the current dominant social paradigm ({DSP}) of hatred, intolerance, abuse of human rights, dehumanization, exploitation, authoritarianism, poverty, and oppression that plague the human race at the national and international levels. This work proposes a conception of ubuntu as a value system built upon the application of some key moral and democratic values for liberation and transformation. Specifically, ubuntu ethics is defined as a set of values central among which are reciprocity, common good, peaceful relations, emphasis on human dignity, and the value of human life as well as consensus, tolerance, and mutual respect. These features are to operate at the national level. We also argue for a possibility utilizing ubuntu ethical correlates as materials for establishing stable and viable human relations within the international system or global order. Our aim is to conceptualize ubuntu as an ethical idea and praxis, as well as to situate it as an ethical ideal all with a view to making humans better and thus tackling in a systematic manner, our natural and man-made existential predicaments.},

A systematic analysis of the historical evidence suggests that the link between nuclear energy programs and proliferation is overstated. Although such programs increase the technical capacity of a state to build nuclear weapons, they have important countervailing political effects that limit the odds of proliferation. Specifically, nuclear energy programs increase the likelihood that parallel nuclear weapons programs will be detected and face counterproliferation pressures; they also increase the costliness of nonproliferation sanctions. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, states with nuclear energy programs historically have not been significantly more likely to seek or acquire nuclear weapons. A combination of qualitative and quantitative evidence supports
the plausibility of the countervailing political effects of nuclear energy programs.},

	abstract = {Horizontal nuclear proliferation presents what is sometimes referred to as the ‚ÄúNth country problem,‚Äù or identifying which state could be next to acquire nuclear weapons. Nuclear fuel cycle technologies can contribute to both nuclear power generation and weapons development. Consequently, observers often view civilian nuclear programs with suspicion even as research on nuclear latency and the technological inputs of proliferation has added nuance to these discussions. To contribute to this debate, I put forth a simple theoretical proposition: En route to developing a civilian nuclear infrastructure and mastering the fuel cycle, states pass through a proliferation ‚Äúdanger zone.‚Äù States with fuel cycle capabilities below a certain threshold will likely be unable to proliferate. States that pass through the ‚Äúdanger zone‚Äù without proliferating will be unlikely to do so in the future. I support this proposition by introducing preliminary analysis from the Nuclear Fuel Cycle ({NFC}) Index, a new heuristic tool to complement political assessments of the connection between civilian nuclear energy development and nuclear weapons proliferation. I conclude with policy implications for contemporary Iran, Saudi Arabia, Japan, and South Korea. Taken together, this article calls for increased policymaker interaction with historical cases and more sophisticated academic engagement with the nuclear fuel cycle.},

Here, we address this question from an ethical perspective, evaluating different strategies of energy system development in terms of three ethical criteria, which will differentially appeal to proponents of different normative ethical frameworks. Starting from a standard analysis of climate change as arising from an intergenerational collective action problem, we evaluate whether contributions from nuclear energy will, on expectation, increase the likelihood of successfully phasing out fossil fuels in time to avert dangerous global warming. For many socio-economic and geographic contexts, our review of the energy system modeling literature suggests the answer to this question is ‚Äúyes.‚Äù We conclude that, from the point of view of climate change mitigation, investments in nuclear energy as part of a broader energy portfolio will be ethically required to minimize the risks of decarbonization failure, and thus the tail risks of catastrophic global warming. Finally, using a sensitivity analysis, we consider which other aspects of nuclear energy deployment, apart from climate change, have the potential to overturn the ultimate ethical verdict on investments in nuclear energy. Out of several potential considerations (e.g., nuclear waste, accidents, safety), we suggest that its potential interplay ‚Äî whether beneficial or adverse ‚Äî with the proliferation of nuclear weapons is the most plausible candidate.},
